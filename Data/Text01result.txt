AB  - The active coatings supplemented with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (0.16 %,0.32 %, and 0.64 %, respectively) combined with superchilling storage (-3 +/- 0.2degrees C) were used to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and inhibitlipid and protein oxidations of large yellow croaker during 42 days ofsuperchilling storage. EGCG coatings delayed lipid and protein oxidations byinhibiting the generation of H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl groups, andmaintaining a higher Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and sulfhydryl content. We alsoobserved that EGCG treatments maintained myofibrillar organized secondarystructure by keeping higher alpha-helix content, and also stabilized tertiarystructure during superchilling storage. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance(LF-NMR) revealed that EGCG treatments might improve the association of watermolecules with protein for fixed water. In addition, sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) images both showed that these treatments could delay themyofibrillar degradation of fresh fish. Overall, we report that the activecoatings containing EGCG treatments protect the lipid and protein of large yellowcroaker during superchilling storage.

AB  - In general, beta-casein is a stable molecular chaperone. However, the fact thatamyloid fibrils derived from beta-casein has been reported in some cases, whichwere usually associated with some malignant breast diseases. As an importantamino acid, arginine not only exhibits the significance in casein synthesis inmammary gland, but also has great potentiality in inhibiting the amyloid fibrilformation. Therefore, the influence of arginine on the amyloid fibrils formed by beta-casein and further molecular mechanism were studied firstly withmulti-spectroscopic techniques in the present work. The results of Thioflavin Tdetermination, particle size analysis, transmission electron microscopeobservation showed that arginine not only inhibited the aggregation ofbeta-casein at the growth stage, but also depolymerized the mature amyloidfibrils at the saturation stage. The further fluorescence experiment resultsdemonstrated that the complex was formed between beta-casein and arginine.Besides, there was one binding site and 0.48 nm binding distance. Thethermodynamic parameters like DeltaG(0), DeltaS(0), DeltaH(0) were all negative, showing their binding reaction was spontaneous, and hydrogen bond and van derWaals force were the possibly chief intermolecular forces. Furthermore, thesynchronous fluorescence spectra showing that the conformation of beta-casein wasaffected and its tyrosine residues were gradually buried inside the protein. Our research would provide new insights into the treatments for the breastamyloidosis.

TI  - The Impact of Laser-Activated and Conventional Irrigation Techniques on SealerPenetration into Dentinal Tubules.
LID - 10.1089/photob.2022.0017 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The present study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of1-hydroxyethylidene-1, 1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) by using various final irrigation techniques on penetration ofsealer. Background: Traditional irrigation of root canals with a syringe limitsthe ability of sealer penetration. Various irrigants and activation techniques,including sonic and ultrasonic devices and various kinds of lasers, have beenintroduced to improve penetration of sealers into dentinal tubules. Methods: One hundred mandibular premolars were selected. Final irrigation was performed withHEDP or EDTA by conventional syringe irrigation (CI), EndoActivator (EA), passiveultrasonic irrigation (PUI), photon-induced photoacoustic streaming (PIPS), andshock wave-enhanced emission photoacoustic streaming (SWEEPS) methods (n = 10).After obturation of root canals with the EndoSequence BC Sealer, samples wereevaluated using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), which enabledmeasurement of the maximum depth, percentage, and penetration area. Testsperformed for analysis included the Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests.Results: In the EA method, the penetration percentage achieved using HEDP wassignificantly higher than EDTA at both sections (p < 0.05). Irrespective of thefinal irrigation solution employed, the PUI, PIPS, and SWEEPS techniquesexhibited greater tubule penetration values compared with the CI and EAtechniques (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HEDP and EDTA showed similar effects on theamount of penetrated sealer into the dentinal tubules, and the PUI, PIPS andSWEEPS methods provided enhanced EndoSequence BC Sealer penetration compared withthe CI and EA methods. This study was approved by the Near East Universityinstitutional review board (#2020/86-1225).

TI  - Er,Cr:YSGG Laser Surface Modification Effect on Dentin Bonding to Zirconia: An InVitro Study.
LID - 10.1089/photob.2022.0015 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study investigated the effect of dentin surface treatment withthe erbium, chromium-doped yttrium, scandium, gallium, and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG)laser on the bond strength of zirconia to dentin. Background data: Although it iswell-known that resin cement (RC) provides adequate bond strength of zirconiarestorations to the tooth structure, many clinicians were not convinced inbonding reliability to zirconia materials. So, they preferred cementing theircrowns with glass-ionomer cement (GIC). Pretreating the dentin surface isrecommended to improve the adhesion of crowns cemented with GIC or RC. Recently, the Er,Cr:YSGG laser has been widely used for a cavity preparation, conditioning the tooth structure. However, there is not enough research on the bond strengthof zirconia crowns cemented on a Er,Cr:YSGG laser-treated dentin. Methods:Forty-eight molars were cut horizontally at the crest of curvature. The flatdentin surface of 24 molars was left untreated, whereas the dentin surface of theother half was treated using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser 2.78 mum (4.5 W, 8.18 J/cm(2),90 mJ, 60 mus, 50 Hz, 60% air and 80% water). In addition, 48 plates of zirconia were prepared to be cemented with GIC or RC on the dentin surface. So, the molarswere divided into four groups as follows: GIC+untreated dentin; GIC+treateddentin; RC+untreated dentin; and RC+treated dentin. All the specimens weresubjected to shear bond strength test. The mode of failure was determined andadditional samples were prepared to evaluate the cement-dentin interface using a scanning electron microscope. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis ofvariance accompanied by univariate analyses. Results: The bond strength ofzirconia cemented with GIC or bonded with RC significantly increased on aEr,Cr:YSGG laser-treated dentin surface (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dentinpreconditioning with an Er,Cr:YSGG laser significantly improved the bond strengthof zirconia plates to dentin as compared with untreated dentin.

TI  - Interfacial Bond Strength and Morphology of Sound and Caries-affected DentinSurfaces Bonded to Two Resin-modified Glass Ionomer Cements.
LID - 10.2341/21-048-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the shear bond strength and interfacial morphology ofsound and caries-affected dentin (CAD) bonded to two resin-modified glass ionomercements (RMGICs) after 24 hours and two months of storage in simulated body fluidat 37 degrees C. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-four permanent human mandibularfirst molars (32 sound and 32 with occlusal caries, following the InternationalCaries Detection and Assessment System) were selected. Each prepared substrate(sound and CAD) was conditioned (10% polyacrylic acid) and bonded to ActivaBioACTIVE Restorative (Activa) and Fuji II LC (F2LC) as per the manufacturers'instructions. Shear bond strength (SBS) was performed after 24 hours and twomonths of storage. The interfacial surfaces were examined using a digitalmicroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three-way ANOVA, Bonferronipost-hoc tests (alpha=0.05), and independent T-tests were used for multifactorialanalysis. RESULTS: Activa exhibited reduced bond strength values to sound and CADin comparison to F2LC after two time periods (p=0.01). There is a pronouncedenhancement in SBS of F2LC when bonded to CAD (p=0.01) after storage, with nostatistically significant effect on sound dentin (p=0.309). Activa showed stable SBS to sound and CAD immediately and post-aging (p>0.05). However, the evidenceof mineral-like deposits under an SEM attached to the aged, debonded dentinsurfaces, thereby obliterating the exposed dentinal tubules, might support thetissue repair potential of Activa. CONCLUSIONS: The SBS of Activa was lower than F2LC when bonded to sound and CAD, but the bonding stability and sealing ability is advantageous in minimally invasive therapy, suggesting use with a resincomposite coverage when used in stress-bearing areas.

TI  - Influence of the Flowable Resin Layer on Bond Strength Between Resin Cement and aUniversal Adhesive Applied in the Immediate Dentin-sealing Technique.
LID - 10.2341/21-050-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluated the influence of a flowable resin layeron bond strength between resin cement and a universal adhesive applied using animmediate dentin sealing (IDS) technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Coronaryportions of bovine teeth were randomly divided into six groups (n=15). In theIDS.U group, the exposed dentin was immediately sealed with the Single BondUniversal adhesive (3M ESPE) following the self-etching protocol. In the IDS.UFgroup, a layer of Filtek Z350 (3M ESPE) flow resin was applied over the universaladhesive. In the DDS (control) group, the dentin was kept "fresh" and delayeddentin sealing was performed. After 24 hours in distilled water at 37 degrees C, dentin surfaces were treated with pumice, phosphoric acid, and the application ofthe universal adhesive in the IDS.U and IDS. UF groups. The DDS group was treatedwith pumice and the universal adhesive was applied. The samples receivedcylinders of resin cement Rely X Ultimate (3M ESPE) made with the aid of starchtubes of 0.96 mm in diameter and 2 mm in length. They were submitted to themicroshear bond strength test (muSBS) at 0.5 mm/min, after 24 hours (T1) and 3months (T2). The fracture areas were evaluated qualitatively using a DSM 300microscope (KOZO) with 45x magnification and classified as: adhesive, cohesive incement, cohesive in dentin, or mixed. Samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The data were compared statistically between groups using theKruskal-Wallis test, and intra-groups using the Mann-Whitney test (alpha=0.05).RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups for the bondstrength values (p>0.05). The IDS.UF group showed higher values at 3 months, whencompared to the values of 24 hours (p<0.001). All groups showed a predominance ofadhesive fracture (86.7% to 100%). SEM showed dentinal tubules exposed in theIDS.U and DDS groups; in the IDS.UF group, the tubules were completely sealed.CONCLUSIONS: The flow resin can be used on the adhesive when using the IDStechnique because it increased the bond strength values after 3 months andpromoted effective sealing of the dentinal tubules.

TI  - Heterogeneous electro-Fenton using three-dimension Fe-Co-Bi/kaolin particleelectrodes for degradation of quinoline in wastewater.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22232-4 [doi]
AB  - Wastewater containing quinoline has become a common pollutant in water and soilenvironments, which poses a threat to human health due to its carcinogenicity,teratogenicity, and mutagenicity. Quinoline's stability and toxicity hinders its degradation by conventional physicochemical and biological methods. In thiscontribution, Fe-Co-Bi/kaolin particle electrodes were prepared for the efficientdegradation of quinoline in wastewater, and characterized by using scanningelectron microscope, X-ray diffraction, pyridine-IR, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and four-probe resistivity test. Parametersaffecting the degradation efficiency were optimized to be the particle electrode dosage of 40 g/L, pH 3.5, H2O2 addition of 67.6 mmol/L, electrical conductivityof 12.7 ms/cm, and voltage of 20 V. The constructed three-dimensional catalyticparticle electrode system (3D-CPE) achieved 92.1% removal rate of chemical oxygendemand (COD) under the optimal conditions. Hydroxyl radicals (*OH) generated inthe 3D-CPE process were identified by radical scavenging tests and electron spin response analysis. To unravel the degradation mechanism, the intermediateproducts were identified by using high performance liquid chromatography-massspectrometry. The degradation mechanism was discussed with the help oftheoretical calculation.

TI  - Host-Endosymbiont Relationship Impacts the Retention of Bacteria-ContainingAmoeba Spores in Porous Media.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02899 [doi]
AB  - Amoebae are protists that are commonly found in water, soil, and other habitatsaround the world and have complex interactions with other microorganisms. In thiswork, we investigated how host-endosymbiont interactions between amoebae andbacteria impacted the retention behavior of amoeba spores in porous media. Amodel amoeba species, Dictyostelium discoideum, and a representative bacterium,Burkholderia agricolaris B1qs70, were used to prepare amoeba spores that carried bacteria. After interacting with B. agricolaris, the retention of D. discoideumspores was enhanced compared to noninfected spores. Diverse proteins, especially proteins contributing to the looser exosporium structure and cell adhesionfunctionality, are secreted in higher quantities on the exosporium surface ofinfected spores compared to that of noninfected ones. Comprehensive examinations using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), a parallel platechamber, and a single-cell force microscope present coherent evidence thatchanges in the exosporium of D. discoideum spores due to infection by B.agricolaris enhance the connections between spores in the suspension and thespores that were previously deposited on the collector surface, thus resulting inmore retention compared to the uninfected ones in porous media. This workprovides novel insight into the retention of amoeba spores after bacterialinfection in porous media and suggests that the host-endosymbiont relationshipregulates the fate of biocolloids in drinking water systems, groundwater, andother porous environments.

TI  - Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of TitaniumOxide Nanocrystals.
PG  - e2203320
LID - 10.1002/adma.202203320 [doi]
AB  - Titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) nanocrystals have attracted great attention inheterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However,contradictious conclusions on the reporting of crystallographic orientation andexposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appeared in the literature.Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as amodel, we clarified the misleading conclusions that exist on anatasenanocrystals. Although the TiO2 -001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominating {001} and{111} facets are always co-existing due to the similarities in lattice fringesand intersection angles between two types of facets (0.38 nm and 90 degrees in[001] direction, 0.35 nm and 82 degrees in [111] direction). We also give aparadigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facetsbased on transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, which provides auniversal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation andexposed facets.

TI  - Automatic analysis system for abnormal red blood cells in peripheral bloodsmears.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24215 [doi]
AB  - The type and ratio of abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) in blood can be identified through peripheral blood smear test. Accurate classification is important becausethe accompanying diseases indicated by abnormal RBCs vary. In clinical practice, this task is time-consuming because the RBCs are manually classified. Inaddition, because the classification depends on the subjective criteria ofpathologists, objective classification is difficult to achieve. In this paper, anautomatic classification method that is solely based on images of RBCs capturedunder a microscope and processed using machine learning (ML) is proposed. Thesize and hemoglobin abnormalities of RBCs were classified by optimizing thecriteria used in clinical practice. For morphologically abnormal RBCsclassification, used seven geometric features information (major axis, minoraxis, ratio of major and minor axis, perimeter, circularity, number of convexhulls, difference between area and convex area) and five types of multipleclassifiers (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, RandomForest, and Adaboost models). Among was categorized using SVM, highly accurateresults (99.9%) were obtained. The classification is performed simultaneously,and results are provided to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI).

AB  - Aim: The present study aimed to explore the sensitizing capability of theanticancer agents, gemcitabine (GEM) and oxaliplatin (OXA), encapsulated in anovel SLN (GEM:OXA-SLN) against the ovarian cancer cell lines. METHODS: A novelSLN, prepared using hot homogenization by mixing phosphatidylcholine,cholesterol, tween 80 and oleic acid, was characterized using TransmissionElectron Microscope and zetasizer. The anticancer activities and the underlyingmolecular mechanisms of GEM:OXA-SLN were investigated. RESULTS: The averagez-diameter of the homogeneous spherical GEM:OXA-SLN was (70.33 +/- 0.70) nm with zeta potential (-7.69 +/- 0.61) mV. GEM:OXA-SLN significantly inhibited theviability of ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner within 24 h. It alsotriggered the induction of autophagy cellular death, suppression of multidrugresistance efflux pump and inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp90). CONCLUSION: The encapsulation of GEM and OXA in SLN improved the efficacy of the drugs anddiminished the ovarian cancer cell's resistance.

TI  - Experimental platform for the functional investigation of membrane proteins ingiant unilamellar vesicles.
LID - 10.1039/d2sm00551d [doi]
AB  - Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are micrometer-sized model membrane systemsthat can be viewed directly under the microscope. They serve as scaffolds for thebottom-up creation of synthetic cells, targeted drug delivery and have beenwidely used to study membrane related phenomena in vitro. GUVs are also ofinterest for the functional investigation of membrane proteins that carry outmany key cellular functions. A major hurdle to a wider application of GUVs inthis field is the diversity of existing protocols that are optimized forindividual proteins. Here, we compare PVA assisted and electroformationtechniques for GUV formation under physiologically relevant conditions, andanalyze the effect of immobilization on vesicle structure and membrane tightness towards small substrates and protons. There, differences in terms of yield, size,and leakage of GUVs produced by PVA assisted swelling and electroformation werefound, dependent on salt and buffer composition. Using fusion of oppositelycharged membranes to reconstitute a model membrane protein, we find that emptyvesicles and proteoliposomes show similar fusion behavior, which allows for arapid estimation of protein incorporation using fluorescent lipids.

PG  - E4
LID - 10.3171/2022.5.FOCUS2261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Training of residents is an essential but time-consuming and costlytask in the surgical disciplines. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,surgical education became even more challenging because of the reduced caseloaddue to the increased shift to corona care. In this context, augmented 360 degrees3D virtual reality (VR) videos of surgical procedures enable effective off-sitetraining through virtual participation in the surgery. The goal of this study wasto establish and evaluate 360 degrees 3D VR operative videos for neurosurgicaltraining. METHODS: Using a 360 degrees camera, the authors recorded threestandard neurosurgical procedures: a lumbar discectomy, brain metastasisresection, and clipping of an aneurysm. Combined with the stereoscopic view ofthe surgical microscope, 7- to 10-minute 360 degrees 3D VR videos augmented with annotations, overlays, and commentary were created. These videos were thenpresented to the neurosurgical residents at the authors' institution using ahead-mounted display. Before viewing the videos, the residents were asked to fillout a questionnaire indicating their VR experience and self-assessment ofsurgical skills regarding the specific procedure. After watching the videos, the residents completed another questionnaire to evaluate their quality andusefulness. The parameters were scaled with a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS:Twenty-two residents participated in this study. The mean years of experience of the participants in neurosurgery was 3.2 years, ranging from the 1st through the 7th year of training. Most participants (86.4%) had no or less than 15 minutes ofVR experience. The overall quality of the videos was rated good to very good.Immersion, the feeling of being in the operating room, was high, and almost allparticipants (91%) stated that 360 degrees VR videos provide a useful addition tothe neurosurgical training. VR sickness was negligible in the cohort.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors demonstrated the feasibility and highacceptance of augmented 360 degrees 3D VR videos in neurosurgical training.Augmentation of 360 degrees videos with complementary and interactive content hasthe potential to effectively support trainees in acquiring conceptual knowledge. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of their use inimproving surgical skills.

TI  - Dating of polyhalite: a difficult (40)Ar/(39)Ar dating tool of diagenetic to verylow-grade metamorphic processes.

AB  - Halite already deforms at surface temperatures. A valuable universal dating tool to constrain the timing of sedimentary, diagenetic, or deformational structuresis still missing. The evaporite mineral polyhalite can be dated by the(40)Ar/(39)Ar method. On the example of the extremely deformed halite deposits ofthe Eastern Alps, polyhalite was tested to date early diagenetic stages of thedeposits. The sedimentological investigation of the present study indicates that some of the macrostructures of polyhalite had a syn-depositional origin duringthe late Permian. It is supposed that polyhalite originated during reflux ofbrines. All samples selected for age dating represent characteristic microfabric types of euhedral to subhedral polyhalite crystals. Intact macro- andnon-recrystallized looking microstructures of polyhalite can be expected to give plateau ages. However, nearly all measurements produced overdispersed data thatdo not define an age. The oldest age steps thus represent only minimum ages. Acloser look revealed grain boundary migration, subgrain rotationrecrystallization, twinning, and fluid-supported grain size increase. Theserecovery processes obscured the original ages and/or reflect the origin of newpolyhalite in place of the original individuals. Based on these microstructures, the age data are supposed to reflect the circulation of aqueous fluids. Justextremely careful separation of individual crystals or in situ age dating underthe microscope will be successful in dating polyhalite. Nevertheless, polyhalite can potentially serve to date deformational events of halite deposits due to its easy recrystallization property.

LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32046-0 [doi]
AB  - The demand for high-throughput electron tomography is rapidly increasing inbiological and material sciences. However, this 3D imaging technique iscomputationally bottlenecked by alignment and reconstruction which runs fromhours to days. We demonstrate real-time tomography with dynamic 3D tomographicvisualization to enable rapid interpretation of specimen structure immediately asdata is collected on an electron microscope. Using geometrically complex chiralnanoparticles, we show volumetric interpretation can begin in less than 10minutes and a high-quality tomogram is available within 30 minutes. Real-timetomography is integrated into tomviz, an open-source and cross-platform 3D dataanalysis tool that contains intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUI), to enable any scientist to characterize biological and material structure in 3D.

AB  - Monocyte and macrophage recruitment occurs to the injured vessel wall afterpercutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of stenotic arteriovenous fistulas(AVF) through increased expression of MCP-1 leading to venous neointimalhyperplasia (VNH) and venous stenosis (VS). We hypothesized that adventitialdelivery of Bindarit, an oral selective inhibitor of MCP-1, -2, and -3encapsulated in poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles embedded in athermosensitive Pluronic F127 hydrogel (BN NP) could prevent VNH/VS formation in a murine model of PTA with AVF. Scanning electron microscope and dynamic lightscattering were used to characterize the BN NP and control nanoparticles (NP C). Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to study drug release kinetics. Immediately after PTA, in a murine model of AVF stenosis, BN NP or NP C was administrated to the adventitia of outflow veins. Animals were sacrificed 3 and 21 days later for gene expression, histomorphometric, andimmunohistochemical analyses. Doppler ultrasound was performed weekly. There was no difference in the size and storage modulus of BN NP compared controls.Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated increased drug release from BN NP whencompared to controls. BN NP treated vessels had reduced MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3gene and protein levels, reduced macrophage/monocyte abundance, proinflammatorycytokines, and venous fibrosis resulting in positive vascular remodeling andimproved patency with reduced VNH/VS. There was increased peak velocity 21 daysafter PTA in the BN NP group. Adventitial administration of BN NP to the outflow vein after PTA results in decreased VNH/VS. Background: Monocyte and macrophagerecruitment occurs to the injured vessel wall after percutaneous transluminalangioplasty (PTA) of stenotic arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) through increasedexpression of MCP-1 leading to venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) and venousstenosis (VS). We hypothesized that adventitial delivery of Bindarit, an oralselective inhibitor of MCP-1, -2, and -3 encapsulated in poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles embedded in a thermosensitive Pluronic F127 hydrogel(BN NP) could prevent VNH/VS formation in a murine model of PTA with AVF.Translational Significance: Adventitial administration of BN NP to the outflowvein after PTA results in decreased VNH/VS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid Phosphatase (ACP) and Alkaline Phosphatases (ALP) are hydrolasesthat remove phosphate groups from protein and nucleic acid respectively forregulation of cell function from ACP as lysosomal defence function and ALPmembrane-bound as a barrier of the cell. The ACP and ALP-specific activities ofMeningiomas (n=75) and gliomas (n=81) were compared among brain tumors, normalbrain, and derived primary cell culture. METHODS: Total Protein and Phosphatases assays estimated by Spectrophotometer and Native PAGE Gel Electrophoresis. Brain tumor and primary explant lysosome studies were performed with an electronmicroscope. RESULTS: Average ACP specific activity exhibited 9.32617 +/- 4.1144for meningiomas (n=55) and 5.91+/- 5.8305 for gliomas (n=60) respectively ascompared to normal brain 7.104 +/- 1.33 (n=120) nm/min/mg of protein. Average ALPexhibited 37.1862 +/- 39.91 (n=36) for meningiomas and 5.91+/-5.83 (n=60) forgliomas respectively as compared to normal brain (n=117) 2.463 +/-1.01nm/min/mgof protein. ACP and ALP exhibited higher activities for meningiomas but not forgliomas as compared to normal brain, in contrast, both expressed more activities in the majority of glioma cell lines and lower in meningioma cell lines.Interestingly gliomas exhibited similar average specific activities for ACP andALP. While GBM IV exhibits lower ALP activities due to cell migration and higher ACP activity correlate too many storage lysosomes from Electron microscopicobservation as compared to meningiomas. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ALP activities can besurrogate markers from meningiomas G-I, G-II to G-III respectively. Howevermeningiomas G-III are similar to gliomas excluding Anaplastic OligodendrogliomaG- III which is similar to Meningiomas G-I even for cells growth patterns.Therefore, an ALP level in meningiomas indicates complementary diagnosis asantibody-ALP conjugates with anticancer drugs for efficiency in targeting braintumor reduction.

AB  - In this work, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)-beta-cyclodextrin grafted pullulan (GCDPu)was synthesized and used to form nanoparticles for liver-specific drug delivery. GCDPu was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR). The self-aggregated nanoparticles (GCDPu NPs) witha spherical dimension of about 200nm were prepared and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Doxorubicin (DOX) was selected as an anti-cancer model drug, and the drug-loaded GCDPu NPs were prepared by the emulsion solvent evaporation method. Moreover, thedrug encapsulation efficiency (LE%) and loading content (LC%) were determined.Slow DOX release from DOX/GCDPu NPs was confirmed. GCDPu NPs were cytocompatible with Bel-7404 cells and showed high cellular uptake according to the MTT assay,confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FCM) results.Compared with free DOX, DOX/GCDPu NPs have exhibited a longer half-life time(t1/2) and a larger area-under-the-curve (AUC). GCDPu NPs significantly increasedDOX contents in the liver and decreased in heart and kidney. Furthermore,DOX/GCDPu NPs exhibited a better anticancer therapeutic effect on tumor-bearingmice. These findings suggest that GCDPu can serve a liver-specific drug delivery system.

AB  - Understanding light-matter interaction at the nanoscale by observation of finedetails of electromagnetic fields is achieved by bringing nanoscale probes intothe nearfield of light sources, capturing information that is lost in the farfield. Although metal coated probes are often used for nearfield microscopy, theystrongly perturb the electromagnetic fields under study. Here, through experimentand simulation, we detail light collection by uncoated fiber probes, whichminimize such perturbation. Second-harmonic light from intensely-irradiatedsub-wavelength sub-surface features was imaged to avoid otherwise dominatingfundamental light background, yielding clear nearfield details through a 50 nmaperture uncoated probe with approximately 23 nm optical resolution. Simulations show how a metallic coating distorts optical nearfields and limits opticalcoupling into the probe in comparison to an uncoated probe.

AB  - As the thermonuclear fuel container, the inertial confinement fusion (ICF)microspheres must be detected before the ICF experiment to maximize the profitsof fusion reactions. However, in the current detection method, the ICFmicrosphere is in direct contact with the measurement platform, resulting in the ICF microsphere surface being easily damaged during the detection process. Inthis paper, an ultrasonic manipulation method is proposed, realizingnon-destructive, high-precision, and high-efficient manipulation of the ICFmicrosphere by switching the two acoustic fields produced in the liquid. Whendetecting the ICF microsphere, the first acoustic field (1st AF) accurately trapsthe microsphere in the acoustic field center to achieve its precise positioning. And when the ICF microsphere is failed to pass the detection, it is transferredout of the microscope measurement area by switching to the second acoustic field (2nd AF). Two solid vibration modes, their corresponding acoustic fields, and thetwo acoustic streaming fields are first computed by the finite element method.Then, the manipulation experiments indicated that the ICF microspheres can befirst driven to the center of the 1st AF and then be positioned here with aminimum positional fluctuation of 1.1 mum. By changing to the 2nd AF, thepositioned microsphere can be transferred nearly 11 mm to the nearest antinodefrom the acoustic field center. Finally, based on the proposed ultrasonicmanipulation method, the detection experiments of the ICF microsphere werecarried out, illustrating that the positioning of the 1st AF meets therequirements of the morphology detection and the radius measurement of the ICFmicrosphere. The proposed method holds the advantages of non-destructive,high-precision, simple control scheme and meets the practical application needsof the microsphere fixed-point detection, presenting the potential promise forthe field of microsphere detection.

AB  - Focusing objects accurately over short time scales is an essential and nontrivialtask for a variety of microscopy applications. In this Letter, an autofocusingalgorithm using pixel difference with the Tanimoto coefficient (PDTC) isdescribed to predict the focus. Our method can robustly distinguish differencesin clarity among datasets. The generated auto-focusing curves have extremely highsensitivity. A dataset of a defocused stack acquired by an Olympus microscopedemonstrates the feasibility of our technique. This work can be applied infull-color microscopic imaging systems and is also valid for single-colorimaging.

AB  - Integrated photonics provides a path for miniaturization of an optical system to a compact chip scale and offers reconfigurability by the integration of activecomponents. Here we report a chip-scale reconfigurable scan lens based on anoptical phased array, consisting of 30 actively controlled elements on the InPintegrated photonic platform. By configuring the phase shifters, we show scanningof a nearly diffraction-limited focused spot with a full width at half maximumspot size down to 2.7 microm at the wavelength of 1550 nm. We demonstrate the keyfunctions needed for a laser-scanning microscope, including light focusing,collection, and steering. We also perform confocal measurements to detectreflection at selective depths.

AB  - Protein delivery and release from synthetic scaffold materials are majorchallenges within the field of bone tissue engineering. In this study, 13-93B1.5 borosilicate bioactive glass (BSG) base paste was 3D printed to produce BSG-basedscaffolds with high porosity (59.85 +/- 6.04%) and large pore sizes (350-400 mum)for functionalization with a sodium alginate (SA)/calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) hydrogel mixture. SA/CGRP hydrogel was uniformly filled into theinterconnected pores of 3D printed BSG constructs to produce BSG-SA/CGRPscaffolds which were subject to bioactivity and biocompatibility analysis. BSGscaffolds filled with SA hydrogel underwent dissolution in simulated body fluid(SBF), resulting in the precipitation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the borosilicate glass evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersivespectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR). Around 90% of CGRP was released from scaffolds after 7 days of immersion in SBF, reaching a final released concentration of 893.00 +/- 63.30 ng/mL. Cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of human bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) cultured with BSG-SA/CGRP scaffolds revealedimproved biocompatibility and osteogenic capabilities compared with BSG-SAscaffolds in the absence of CGRP. When subcutaneously implanted in rat models,BSG-SA/CGRP scaffolds induced low localized inflammation without causing bodilyharm in vivo. Findings revealed that bioactive glass scaffolds incorporating CGRPmet the scaffold requirements for bone regeneration and that the addition of CGRPpromoted osteogenic differentiation where it may potentially be utilized forfuture regenerative applications.

AB  - The main aim of the study was to determine the effect of two polysaccharides:chitosan (Ch) and hyaluronic acid (HA), and/or titanium dioxide (TiO2) on thestructure and behaviour of the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)membrane. To achieve this goal the surface pressure as a function of the area permolecule (pi-A) isotherm for the phospholipid monolayer was recorded. The shapeof the pi-A isotherms and compression-decompression cycles, as well as thecompression modulus values, were analysed in terms of biocompatibility. Besides, morphology and thickness of the phospholipid layers obtained by means of Brewsterangle microscope at different pi, were determined. The obtained results show thatboth polysaccharides Ch, HA, as well inorganic TiO2 affect slightly the structureof the DOPC monolayer but do not disrupt it. Their presence brings no typicalarrangements of both the polar heads and tails of DOPC molecules at theinterface.

TI  - Cryo-electron Tomography Remote Data Collection and Subtomogram Averaging.
LID - 10.3791/63923 [doi]
AB  - Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has been gaining momentum in recent years,especially since the introduction of direct electron detectors, improvedautomated acquisition strategies, preparative techniques that expand thepossibilities of what the electron microscope can image at high-resolution using cryo-ET and new subtomogram averaging software. Additionally, data acquisitionhas become increasingly streamlined, making it more accessible to many users. TheSARS-CoV-2 pandemic has further accelerated remote cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM) data collection, especially for single-particle cryo-EM, in manyfacilities globally, providing uninterrupted user access to state-of-the-artinstruments during the pandemic. With the recent advances in Tomo5 (software for 3D electron tomography), remote cryo-ET data collection has become robust andeasy to handle from anywhere in the world. This article aims to provide adetailed walk-through, starting from the data collection setup in the tomography software for the process of a (remote) cryo-ET data collection session withdetailed troubleshooting. The (remote) data collection protocol is furthercomplemented with the workflow for structure determination at near-atomicresolution by subtomogram averaging with emClarity, using apoferritin as anexample.

TI  - A novel approach for forensic identification of automotive paints using opticalcoherence tomography and multivariate statistical methods.
LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.15114 [doi]
AB  - Automotive paint is one of the most important evidence in solving vehicle-relatedcriminal cases. It contains the critical information about the suspected vehicle,providing essential clues for the investigation. In this study, a novel approach based on optical coherence tomography combined with multivariate statisticalmethods was proposed to facilitate rapid, accurate and nondestructiveidentification of different brands of automotive paints. 164 automotive paintsamples from 8 different manufacturers were analyzed by a spectral-domain opticalcoherence tomography system (SD-OCT). Two-dimensional cross-sectional OCT images and three-dimensional OCT reconstruction of vehicle paints of different paintswere obtained to show the internal structural differences. Visual discrimination of A-scan data after registration and averaging processing was first used todistinguish different samples. An scanning electron microscope was utilized toobtain the cross-sectional image of the sample to evaluate the effectiveness ofOCT technique. Then the original A-scan data, first derivative data and secondderivative data of 136 paints with four layers from 7 different manufacturerswere collected. Multivariate statistical methods, including principal componentanalysis (PCA), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and Bayes discriminant analysis (BDA), were used to analyze different datasets.The results show the hybrid PCA and BDA model based on the first derivative OCTdata achieved the best result of 100% accuracy on the testing dataset foridentifying automotive paints. It is demonstrated that the OCT technique combinedwith multivariate statistics could be a promising method for identifying theautomotive paints rapidly and accurately.

TI  - High counting of circulating tumor cells in blood is not directly related tometastasis.
LID - 10.1002/cyto.a.24672 [doi]
AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood flow have been believed as an essentialbiomarker of cancer. The technologies of in vitro and in vivo CTC enrichment and detection suggest although CTCs might play a role of "seed" in metastasis, onlythe minority of CTCs, probably in the form of CTC clusters, hold the potential todevelop a tumor in organs. The detected amount of CTCs might be solely anindicator of tumor burden. To provide new insights into this argument, we takeadvantage of a safe drug to tune the pacemaker activity of a mouse tumor model toincrease the heart rate for a period of time every day during the tumordevelopment. We detect the CTCs in vivo by fast line scanning of a confocalmicroscope when the heart rate returns to the baseline and find the average CTCamount is significantly elevated in the drug-treated group but the metastases areeven less than that of control. Our results imply the detected CTC counts inblood might not be directly related to metastasis.

TI  - Pulp chamber temperature changes and enamel surface analysis during orthodonticcomposite removal using 3 different burs in a repeatable approach: anexperimental study.
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6329.22.04692-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the debonding phase every clinician has to take care ofpreserving the enamel structure and tooth temperature. The objective of thisstudy is to analyze in vitro the increase of the pulp chamber temperature and thewearing of enamel surface, during adhesive removal after debonding. METHODS: 60extracted human teeth were selected. An orthodontic bracket was bonded on eachtooth and after bracket removal, intraoral scanner pictures were used to evaluateARI for each tooth. 3 different burs were tested: Tungsten-carbide multipleblade, Arkansas stone and Ceramic bur. A mechanical arm controlled by a dedicatedsoftware was used to reproduce a repeatable act of composite removal. To analyze in vitro the pulp chamber temperature during the composite removal procedure,teeth were treated endodontically placing a thermocouple through the root canalfrom the apex. A software registered temperature changes in a continuous manner. The enamel surface of every tooth was tested after the removal of composite with an optical stereoscopic microscope. RESULTS: An association existed betweenmaximum internal pulp chamber temperature variation and irrigation (P-value <0.0001) and between maximum internal pulp chamber temperature variation and burtype (P-value = 0.0133), with a significantly lower temperature increase producedby the Arkansas bur. A significant difference among groups was detected for ESIand EDI assessment (P-value = 0.002, P-value = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Consideringthe initial setup, temperature variation analysis showed more conservativeresults using the Arkansas burs with irrigation. ESI and EDI indexes showedsignificant enamel surface damage using Tungsten-carbide burs.

PG  - 3636795
LID - 10.1155/2022/3636795 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Using a modified thermal cycling method to establish narrow root fracturemodels and evaluate the diagnosis efficiency of them using four differentcone-beam CT (CBCT) units. Methodology. Fifty-six intact teeth were selected, andthe crowns of the teeth were embedded using general purpose acrylic resin. 50root fracture models were established by soaking these teeth in liquid nitrogenand hot water cyclically; 6 teeth were used as the negative control. All the 56teeth were scanned with the smallest voxel size of four different CBCT units(NewTom VGi, Planmeca Promax 3D Max, Kavo 3D eXam, and Soredex Scanora3D). 10teeth were randomly selected, and the roots were sliced using slow-speed saw toobtain horizontal root sections. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used tomeasure the width of the fracture lines (FLs). The CBCT images were evaluated forthe presence or absence of fracture lines. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) werecalculated for the diagnosis of FLs using the four CBCT units. Results: Fiftynarrow root fracture models were successfully established, and 25 root sectionswith 45 FLs were acquired. The width of FLs was from 3.43 mum to 143 mum; 32.2%of the points had width under 25 mum, while only 9.6% of them had width over 75mum. The accuracy was 0.41, 0.54, 0.41, and 0.30 for NewTom VGi, Planmeca Promax 3D Max, Kavo 3D eXam, and Soredex Scanora3D, respectively. Conclusions: Themodified temperature cycling method is a simple and effective method to establishnarrow root fracture models, and the diagnosis efficiency for these narrowfracture lines was quite poor using all the four different CBCT units.

AB  - Background: There is still debate about the most appropriate restorative materialcategory to relocate the proximal deep cervical margins, thus, this study aimedto compare the marginal and internal adaptation of four base materials used fordeep margin elevation, and to evaluate each base material/overlying compositeinterface. Material and Methods: Fifty six molars received class II cavities withdentin/cementum gingival margins. They were divided into four groups and theirgingival margins were elevated using either; resin modified glass ionomer (RMGI),highly viscous conventional glass ionomer (HV-GIC), flowable bulk fill resincomposite (Bulk Flow) and bioactive ionic resin (Activa). The rest of thecavities were completed with the same overlying composite. Half of each group waseither; kept in sterile water for 1 week, or subjected to 18 months water storageand 15,000 thermal cycles. Base materials/gingival dentin interfaces wereexamined under a scanning electron microscope at different magnifications, andpercentage of continuous margin (% CM) and maximum gap width (MGW) were analyzed,in addition to base materials/overlying composite interfaces evaluations. % CMvalues were statistically analyzed using Two-way analysis of variance, Tukey posthoc tests (at p<0.05) and Pearson's correlation while MGW values were analyzedusing Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearmen correlation. Results:Both Bulk Flow and Activa had better marginal integrity than RMGI and HV-GIC. Allbase materials were adversely affected by aging. All base materials/overlyingcomposite interfaces were continuous and age defying. Conclusions: In terms ofmarginal integrity, Bulk Flow and Activa might be preferable for proximal dentin margin elevation under direct restoration compared to the other tested basematerials. Key words:Deep proximal margin, interface analysis, marginal quality, open sandwich technique.

AB  - Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and the secondleading cause of death in cancer patients. There is an urgent need for aneffective and less toxic treatment for liver cancer. Saponins of MarsdeniaTenacissima (SMT) as a potential anticancer drug has attracted extensiveattention of researchers because of its effective biological activity. The effectof SMT on HepG2 Li-7 and L-02 cells was detected by CCK8 assay. At the same time,the apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometer and laser confocal microscope, and the morphological changes of mitochondria were observed under electronmicroscope. The levels of bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, cleavedcaspase-3 and protein were detected using Western bolt. Finally, BALB/c wassubcutaneously injected with H22 cells to form tumors, and SMT wasintragastrically injected to detect the size of the transplanted tumor. SMT caninduce apoptosis in vitro and reduce the size of transplanted tumor in vivo.Increases the rate of apoptosis through the cytochrome c pathway and regulatesthe expression of apoptosis-related proteins. These results suggest that SMT may be one of the potential candidates for the treatment of liver cancer.

TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri 1 Enhances Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function andAlleviates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 via Suppressing the MLCK Signaling Pathway in IPEC-J2 Cells.
PG  - 897395
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.897395 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal epithelial barrier injury disrupts immune homeostasis and leads tomany intestinal disorders. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) strains caninfluence immune system development and intestinal function. However, theunderlying mechanisms of L. reuteri LR1 that regulate inflammatory response andintestinal integrity are still unknown. The present study aimed to determine the effects of LR1 on the ETEC K88-induced intestinal epithelial injury on theinflammatory response, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and the MLCKsignal pathway and its underlying mechanism. Here, we showed that the 1 x 10(9)cfu/ml LR1 treatment for 4 h dramatically decreased interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6expression. Then, the data indicated that the 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml ETEC K88 treatmentfor 4 h dramatically enhanced IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) expression. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) dataindicated that pretreatment with LR1 inhibited the ETEC K88 that adhered onIPEC-J2 and alleviated the scratch injury of IPEC J2 cells. Moreover, LR1pretreatment significantly reversed the declined transepithelial electricalresistance (TER) and tight junction protein level, and enhanced the induction by ETEC K88 treatment. Additionally, LR1 pretreatment dramatically declined IL-8,IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels compared with the ETEC K88 group. Then, ETECK88-treated IPEC-J2 cells had a higher level of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK),higher MLC levels, and a lower Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) level than thecontrol group, while LR1 pretreatment significantly declined the MLCK and MLCexpression and enhanced ROCK level in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2 cells.Mechanistically, depletion of MLCK significantly declined MLC expression inIPEC-J2 challenged with ETEC K88 compared to the si NC+ETEC K88 group. On theother hand, the TER of the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was higher and the FD4 flux in the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was lower compared with the si NC+ETEC K88 group. Inaddition, depletion of MLCK significantly enhanced Claudin-1 level and declinedIL-8 and TNF-alpha levels in IPEC-J2 pretreated with LR1 followed by challenging with ETEC K88. In conclusion, our work indicated that L. reuteri LR1 can decline inflammatory response and improve intestinal epithelial barrier function through suppressing the MLCK signal pathway in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2.

AB  - Purpose: Validation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in digitalpathology with a reference standard is necessary before widespread clinical use, but few examples focus on creating a reference standard based on pathologistannotations. This work assesses the results of a pilot study that collectsdensity estimates of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breastcancer biopsy specimens. This work will inform the creation of a validationdataset for the evaluation of AI algorithms fit for a regulatory purpose.Approach: Collaborators and crowdsourced pathologists contributed glass slides,digital images, and annotations. Here, "annotations" refer to any marks,segmentations, measurements, or labels a pathologist adds to a report, image,region of interest (ROI), or biological feature. Pathologists estimated sTILsdensity in 640 ROIs from hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of 64 patients via two modalities: an optical light microscope and two digital image viewingplatforms. Results: The pilot study generated 7373 sTILs density estimates from29 pathologists. Analysis of annotations found the variability of densityestimates per ROI increases with the mean; the root mean square differences were 4.46, 14.25, and 26.25 as the mean density ranged from 0% to 10%, 11% to 40%, and41% to 100%, respectively. The pilot study informs three areas of improvement forfuture work: technical workflows, annotation platforms, and agreement analysismethods. Upgrades to the workflows and platforms will improve operability andincrease annotation speed and consistency. Conclusions: Exploratory data analysisdemonstrates the need to develop new statistical approaches for agreement. Thepilot study dataset and analysis methods are publicly available to allowcommunity feedback. The development and results of the validation dataset will bepublicly available to serve as an instructive tool that can be replicated bydevelopers and researchers.

AB  - This study was designed for determining the effect of particle size on thefunctional properties of corn bran insoluble dietary fiber (IDF). Results showed that some physicochemical properties were improved with the decrease in particle size. The structure of the IDF was observed by the scanning electron microscope(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR). The surface was found wrinkled and sparse, the particle size wassmaller, the crystallinity of IDF had increased slightly, and more -OH and C-Ogroups were exposed. Moreover, the corn bran IDF with a smaller particle size hada better hypoglycemic effect in vitro, and the inhibitory activity ofalpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase were also increased significantly with thedecrease in particle size (p < 0.05). When the IDF was 300 mesh, the inhibitoryrate of alpha-glucosidase was 61.34 +/- 1.12%, and the inhibitory rate ofalpha-amylase was 17.58 +/- 0.33%. It had increased by 25.54 and 106.83%,respectively compared to the control treatment (CK) group. In addition,correlation analysis found that the particle size was highly negativelycorrelated with some functional properties of IDF (p < 0.05), and the content of cellulose was positively correlated with the functional properties of IDF except WHC (p < 0.05). To sum up, reducing particle size was suitable for thedevelopment of high value-added IDF products. This study also revealed thepotential value of corn bran IDF and provided a new idea for the diversifiedapplication of IDF.

TI  - Synergistic Antimicrobial Effect of Antimicrobial Peptides CATH-1, CATH-3, andPMAP-36 With Erythromycin Against Bacterial Pathogens.
PG  - 953720
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.953720 [doi]
AB  - With the increasing bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative drugs or adjuvants of antibiotics to enhance antibacterial efficiency. The combination of antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) and traditional antibiotics is a potential alternative to enhanceantibacterial efficiency. In this study, we investigated the synergisticbactericidal effect of AMPs, including chicken (CATH-1,-2,-3, and -B1), mice(CRAMP), and porcine (PMAP-36 and PR-39) in combination with conventionalantibiotics containing ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, and erythromycinagainst Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. The results showed that the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of CATH-1,-3 andPMAP-36 was lower than 10 muM, indicating that these three AMPs had goodbacterial activity against S. aureus, S. enteritidis, and E. coli. Then, thesynergistic antibacterial activity of AMPs and antibiotics combination wasdetermined by the fractional bactericidal concentration index (FBCI). The resultsshowed that the FBCI of AMPs (CATH-1,-3 and PMAP-36) and erythromycin was lowerthan 0.5 against bacterial pathogens, demonstrating that they had a synergisticbactericidal effect. Furthermore, the time-killing kinetics of AMPs (CATH-1,-3and PMAP-36) in combination with erythromycin showed that they had a continuouskilling effect on bacteria within 3 h. Notably, the combination showed lowerhemolytic activity and cytotoxicity to mammal cells compared to erythromycin and peptide alone treatment. In addition, the antibacterial mechanism of CATH-1 anderythromycin combination against E. coli was studied. The results of the scanningelectron microscope showed that CATH-1 enhanced the antibacterial activity oferythromycin by increasing the permeability of bacterial cell membrane. Moreover,the results of bacterial migration movement showed that the combination of CATH-1and erythromycin significantly inhibits the migration of E. coli. Finally, drugresistance analysis was performed and the results showed that CATH-1 delayed the emergence of E. coli resistance to erythromycin. In conclusion, the combinationof CATH-1 and erythromycin has synergistic antibacterial activity and reduces theemergence of bacterial drug resistance. Our study provides valuable informationto develop AMPs as potential substitutes or adjuvants for traditionalantibiotics.

AB  - Lugano Lake is located in an Ecological Reserve of Buenos Aires City.Biomonitoring of its water quality is essential due to its importance as a place for recreation and protection of native species. Biomphalaria straminea is anative hermaphrodite aquatic gastropod that inhabits different freshwater bodies of Argentina and was recently selected as a potential bioindicator. We proposethis study as a first approach to assessing specific organisms' use inbiomonitoring of urban wild reserves, and the usefulness of reproduction assays. B. straminea survival, behavior, reproduction success and offspring survivalafter the exposure to water samples from Lugano Lake (L1, L2, and L3) wereevaluated. Temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen were registered in situ. Samples were transported to the laboratory and chemical analysis andbioassays were performed using 20 snails per site. A control group with tap waterwas added. Egg masses were separated, exposed individually and observed dailyusing a stereoscopic microscope. After hatching, juveniles were placed in tapwater and offspring survival was registered at the first, second, third andfourth months after the beginning of the assay. High levels of conductivity,turbidity and nutrients were obtained. Ammonium and nitrite were higher than the guideline level for the protection of aquatic life. During the bioassay 20% ofthe snails (L2 and L3) showed abnormally protruding of the head-food region. The number of eggs and embryonated eggs per mass did not differ between treatments.Egg masses exposed to water samples from the lake presented overlapping andabnormal eggs and arrested embryos. Besides, low % of hatching (L1: 33%, L2: 42%,and L3: 16%) and juvenile survival after the first (L1:14%; L2:78%) and secondmonth (L1: 60%) were noted. In the control group, 85% of hatching and 100%-90% ofsurvival were observed. Our results suggests the presence of pollutant in thelake. B. straminea seems to be a sensitive local species. Biomphalaria spp.reproduction assays can provide a valuable endpoint for toxicity and riskassessments and a usefulness tool for biomonitoring water quality.

LID - 10.1080/15685551.2022.2099647 [doi]
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring biopolymer, with a remarkable woundhealing property. Zinc-oxide non-eugenol is a material widely used forperiodontal dressing in dentistry. However, it has been reported that zinc oxide non-eugenol is toxic to osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Hence, the present studyaimed to evaluate the drug release and cytotoxicity of HA and zinc-oxide gels.Hydrogels of HA and zinc oxide were formulated with carbopol as a carrier. Invitro drug release was performed by UV spectrophotometry, dialysis, and vial bag methods. Cytotoxicity assessment of HA and zinc-oxide gels was performed in humanperiodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPdLF) and human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs).An inverted phase-contrast microscope was used to assess the morphologicalchanges. At 24 and 48 hr, HPdLF cells showed the highest viability in 0.1% lowmolecular weight-HA (LMW-HA) with a median value of 131.9, and hGFs showed thehighest viability in 5% LMW-HA with a median of 129.56. The highest viability of HPdLF cells was observed in 5% high molecular weight-HA (HMW-HA), with a medianvalue of 127.11. hGFs showed the highest viability in 1% HMW-HA with a medianvalue of 97.99. Within the limitations of the present study, we concluded thatLMW-HA is more efficient than HMW-HA. Both HPdLF and hGF cells showed completecell morbidity with zinc-oxide hydrogels. Therefore, zinc oxide-based gels inconcentrations as low as 9% could be toxic intraorally to soft tissues thatharbor gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.

AB  - The inhibition/degradation potential of Carissa carandas proteinaceous leafextract against mixed bacterial biofilm of Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96,Escherichia coli MTCC 1304, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741, and Klebsiellapneumoniae MTCC 109, responsible for nosocomial infections, was evaluated.Distinct inhibition/degradation of mixed bacterial biofilm by the proteinaceousleaf extract of C. carandas was observed under a microscope, and it was found to be 80%. For mono-species biofilm, the maximum degradation of 70% was observedagainst S. aureus biofilm. The efficiency of aqueous plant extracts to inhibitthe mono-species biofilm was observed in terms of minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC), and the best was found against P. aeruginosa (12.5 mug/ml). The presence of flavonoids, phenols, and tannins in the phytochemical analysis ofthe plant extract suggests the main reason for the antibiofilm property of C.carandas. From the aqueous extract, protein fraction was precipitated using 70%ammonium sulfate and dialyzed. This fraction was purified by ion-exchangechromatography and found to be stable and active at 10 degrees C (pH 7). Thepurified fraction showed less than 40% cytotoxicity, which suggests that it canbe explored for therapeutic purposes after in-depth testing. In order toinvestigate the mechanistic action of the biofilm inhibition, the plant proteinwas tested against Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, and its inhibitory effectconfirmed its quorum quenching nature. Based on these experimental analyses, itcan be speculated that the isolated plant protein might influence the signalingmolecule that leads to the inhibition effect of the mixed bacterial biofilm.Further experimental studies are warranted to validate our current findings.

AB  - Bimetallic silver-copper electrocatalysts are promising materials forelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to fuels and multi-carbonmolecules. Here, we combine Ag core/porous Cu shell particles, which entrapreaction intermediates and thus facilitate the formation of C2+ products at lowoverpotentials, with gas diffusion electrodes (GDE). Mass transport plays acrucial role in the product selectivity in CO2RR. Conventional H-cellconfigurations suffer from limited CO2 diffusion to the reaction zone, thusdecreasing the rate of the CO2RR. In contrast, in the case of GDE-based cells,the CO2RR takes place under enhanced mass transport conditions. Hence,investigation of the Ag core/porous Cu shell particles at the same potentialsunder different mass transport regimes reveals: (i) a variation of productdistribution including C3 products, and (ii) a significant change in the localOH(-) activity under operation.

TI  - PEGylated Recombinant Human Growth Hormone Jintrolong((R)) Exhibits GoodLong-Term Safety in Cynomolgus Monkeys and Human Pediatric Growth HormoneDeficiency Patients.
PG  - 821588
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.821588 [doi]
AB  - Jintrolong((R)) is a long-acting PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone(PEG-rhGH) developed for weekly injection in patients with pediatric growthhormone deficiency (PGHD). Although PEG modification of therapeutic proteins isgenerally considered safe, concerns persist about the potential for adversevacuolation in tissues with long-term exposure to PEG-included therapies,particularly in children. We assessed the safety of Jintrolong((R)) in cynomolgusmonkeys with an examination of vacuolation in the brain choroid plexus (CP) andreported long-term clinical safety data obtained from children with PGHD. Thetoxicity of Jintrolong((R)) was assessed following the 52-week administrationwith doses at 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg/week. The levels of vacuolation of CP in animalswere dose-dependent and at least partially reversible after a 104- or 157-weekrecovery period. Vacuolation in the CP epithelium did not lead to obvioussubcellular structural or cell functional abnormalities. Compared with theclinical dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week Jintrolong((R)) in PGHD patients, exposure inmonkeys under NOAEL 3 mg/kg/week exhibited safety margins greater than 120.5, thepredicted minimum dose to induce vacuolation in monkeys is equivalent to 1.29mg/kg/week in humans, which is 6.45-fold higher than the clinical dose. Thesafety data acquired in clinical trials for Jintrolong((R)) were also analyzed,which included phase III (360 patients), phase IV (3,000 patients) of 26-weektreatment, and a follow-up study with treatment lasting for 3 years. There was nostatistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactionsbetween the Jintrolong((R)) group and the daily rhGH control group (no PEG), and no new adverse effects (AE) were observed in the Jintrolong((R)) group at theclinical therapeutic dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate inducing osteoarthritis (OA) by surgical destabilization of themedial meniscus (DMM) in mice with and without a stereomicroscope. METHODS: Basedon sample size calculation, 70 male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three surgery groups: DMM aided by a stereomicroscope; DMM by naked eye; or shamsurgery. The group information was blinded to researchers. Mice underwent static weightbearing, von Frey test, and gait analysis at two-week intervals from eight to 16 weeks after surgery. Histological grade of OA was determined with theOsteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system. RESULTS:Surgical DMM with or without stereomicroscope led to decrease in the mean ofweightbearing percentages (-20.64% vs -21.44%, p = 0.792) and paw withdrawalresponse thresholds (-21.35% vs -24.65%, p = 0.327) of the hind limbs. However,the coefficient of variation (CV) of weight-bearing percentages and pawwithdrawal response thresholds in naked-eye group were significantly greater thanthat in the microscope group (19.82% vs 6.94%, p < 0.001; 21.85% vs 9.86%, p <0.001). The gait analysis showed a similar pattern. Cartilage degeneration wasobserved in both DMM-surgery groups, evidenced by increased OARSI scores (summed score: 11.23 vs 11.43, p = 0.842), but the microscope group showed less variationin OARSI score than the naked-eye group (CV: 21.03% vs 32.44%; p = 0.032).CONCLUSION: Although surgical DMM aided by stereomicroscope is technicallydifficult, it produces a relatively more homogeneous OA model in terms of thediscrete degree of pain behaviours and histopathological grading when comparedwith surgical DMM without stereomicroscope.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res2022;11(8):518-527.

AB  - Particular batches of Moderna mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinewere recalled after foreign particles were found in some vaccine vials at thevaccination site in Japan in August 2021. We investigated the foreign particlesat the request of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Energy dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy analysis suggested that the foreign particles found in thevials recalled from the vaccination sites were from stainless steel SUS 316L,which was in line with the findings of the root cause investigation by themanufacturer. The sizes of the observed particles ranged from <50 mum to 548 mum in the major axis. Similar foreign particles were also detected in 2 of the 5vaccine vials of the same lot stored by the manufacturer, indicating that theforeign particles have already been administered to some people via vaccine.Observation of the vials of the same lot by digital microscope found smallerparticles those were not detected by visual inspection, suggesting that morevials were affected. Contrarily, visual inspection and subvisible particulatematter test indicated no foreign particles in the vials of normal lots. Possible root cause and strategies to prevent such a deviation were discussed fromtechnical and regulatory aspects.

AB  - Biodegradable porous scaffolds with different structure, porosity, and strengthplay a critical role in the repair and regeneration of defects in bone tissueengineering by changing the proliferation condition for cell. In this study,polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold with directional porous structure is designed and fabricated using the method of ice template and phase inversion for speeding upbone repair by promoting the growth and proliferation of bone cells. Themorphology, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and wicking properties of PLA scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscope, universal testingmachine, contact angle tester and wicking rate test, respectively. In vitrobiocompatibility has been investigated through measuring cell adhesion,proliferation, and viability on PLA scaffold with directional porous structure.Prepared PLA scaffold was implanted into animals to observe the repair mechanism of large-sized bone defects. This study proposes a novel bioporous scaffolddesign to induce osteocyte growth at the rat calvaria with a directional porestructure, and the scaffold edges were integrated with the calvaria at week 12,effectively promoting the repair and regeneration of defective bone tissue.

AB  - Chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through waterflooding is the most commonlyused method to improve crude oil displacement and extraction however; the impact of environmental side effects may remain ambiguous. Regarding, flooding taggedwater with tracers provides a better understanding of the fate of injected water and the reservoir conditions more than oil recovery. This study's main focus isthe proposed carbon dots (CDs) to develop fluorescent-tagged with dual functions as a sensing and an enhancing agent for EOR operations. Different physicochemicaland optical properties were obtained for CDs by tuning the surface chemistry ofphenylenediamine (PD) isomers and tartaric acid (TA) via the solvothermal method which leads to green, and yellow fluorescent emissions. Size distribution andcolloidal and thermal stability of the prepared nanofluids carrying CDs werecontrolled by atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and thermogravimetricanalysis (TGA). Long-time emission stability in high temperature and salinitysuch as conditions found in the oil reservoirs was precisely detected byfluorescence spectroscopy and a portable UV cabinet as the on-site detectionmethod to confirm the sensing ability of CDs. While, rheological parameters ofnanofluids such as viscosity, wettability alteration, and fluid/crude oilinterfacial tension were evaluated to support the potential of CDs as anenhancing agent to sweep crude oil on the carbonate rock reservoirs. The oildisplacement mechanism was monitored on the micromodel pattern by recording 27.8 % and 20.5 % displacement factors for the prepared nanofluids carrying 200 ppmCDs.

AB  - Oil-water emulsions separation is frequently required considering the production and environmental issues. Herein, a nano-modification strategy has been proposed for carboxylated poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) block polyether(mANP) using epoxy-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2-GPTMS),achieving the construction of a highly efficient demulsifier (M-mANP). Bottletests showed that M-mANP could separate over 98.5% of water from theasphaltene-stabilized water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion at mANP concentration of 150ppm within 2 min at room temperature. The demulsification efficiency for crudeoil-in-water emulsion was nearly 100%. According to interfacial tension andwettability tests, the nano-modification endows M-mANP with good amphiphilicityand high interfacial activity, which enables M-mANP to rapidly adsorb at theoil-water interface. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that abundantoxygen-containing groups (hydroxyl, ether bond, ester and carboxyl groups, Fe-Oand Si-O bond) in M-mANP could strengthen the interaction with water,facilitating the replacement of asphaltene molecules at interfacial film.Observation of demulsification process by microscope reveals that the nano-sizepromotes M-mANP to bridge small dispersed droplets, enhancing the flocculationand coalescence of droplets. The nano-modified carboxylated polyether withoutstanding demulsification ability shows a promising application for thetreatment of different oil-water emulsions.

AB  - Graphene and its composites with semiconductor materials have been receivedhighly attention in many research areas because of their unique properties.Efficient application of graphene is hindered by the lack of cost-effectivesynthesis methods. In this work, an economic and facile route for mass productionof graphene-titanate nanocomposite has been discussed. Graphene was prepared byexfoliation of graphite powder in 40% ethanol aqueous solution. Titanatenanotubes were grown on graphene sheets by hydrothermal method, where thedispersed graphene sheets were mixed with titanate solution and then placed inautoclave and placed in oven for 16 h at 160 degrees C. The prepared compositewas characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electronmicroscope (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All the obtained results confirmed thesynthesis of graphene and its composite with titanate in highly uniform and pure form. The adsorption efficiency of the prepared composite was tested usingmethylene blue (MB) as a model dye. The adsorption isotherm was investigatedusing Freundlich and Langmuir models. The adsorption capacity of MB was 270.27mg/g. The obtained correlation coefficients (R(2)) by Freundlich and Langmuirmodel were 0.996 and 0.973, respectively. The adsorption kinetics wasinvestigated and discussed using different models. The thermal stability of thedeveloped composite is improved after MB adsorption.

AB  - Decontamination of implant surfaces is important to the treatment ofperi-implantitis. Er:YAG laser and air-powder abrasion system are regarded as themost effective means of decontamination of implant surfaces. The aim of this invitro study was to compare the activity of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) cultured on decontaminated sandblasted titanium discs using Er:YAG laserirradiation and air-powder abrasion. Forty-five titanium discs were contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria and fifteen titanium discs served assterile control groups. Thirty contaminated titanium discs were decontaminatedwith Er:YAG laser or air-powder abrasion system and fifteen contaminated discswere used as contaminated control group. Afterwards, hDPSCs were seeded on allsixty experimental titanium discs. The effects of two decontamination tools onhDPSCs viability were evaluated by MTT assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activityassay, quantitative real-time PCR analysis and alizarin red staining method were performed to assess hDPSCs osteogenic differentiation. Scanning microscopeelectron (SEM) was also used to evaluate the effects of two differentdecontaminated methods on cellular morphology. Our study showed thatdecontamination using Er:YAG laser caused maximum cell viability. However, theALP activity was not different in laser and air-abrasion groups. The significant expression of an osteoblastic marker and stronger Alizarin red staining wereobserved in laser irradiation groups. In addition, SEM observation indicated thatgrown cells were more stretched and more filopodia in Er:YAG-treated discs. Inthe present study, Er:YAG laser and air-powder abrasion improved the activity of the cells cultured on the decontaminated titanium discs. However, in comparisonwith air-powder abrasion, Er:YAG laser was more effective.

However, there is a lack of research on the effect of FLX on the surface behavior of lipid monolayers under different surfacepressures. In this study,1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/CHOL (DPPC/POPC/CHOL) monolayers were prepared via the Langmuirmethod, and FLX was added to these monolayers under various surface pressures.The effect of FLX on the surface behavior of DPPC/POPC/CHOL monolayers undervarious surface pressures was studied using a combination of surfacepressure-area isotherms, compressibility modulus-surface pressure curves, andatomic force microscope (AFM). The results showed that the effect of FLX on thelipid monolayers was different under different surface pressures. The interactionbetween FLX and lipid molecules was weak under low surface pressures, and FLXcould easily intercalate between the lipid molecules to inhibit monolayer phasetransition. The interaction between FLX and lipid molecules was enhanced and FLX tended to self-aggregate to reduce the monolayer stability when the surfacepressure was high. This study lays the foundation for further studies on theinteraction between FLX and lipid monolayers.

AB  - The development of full-length infectious cDNA clones for plant RNA viruses isimportant for studying their molecular biological characteristics, functionalgenomics, pathogenesis, and vectorization applications. Citrus mosaic virus(CiMV), a member of Sadwavirus, is of economic importance to the citrus industry and comprises a bipartite, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomeencapsidated in icosahedral virions. In the present study, full-length cDNAclones of CiMV RNA1 and RNA2 were constructed based on a ternaryyeast-Escherichia coli-Agrobacterium tumefaciens shuttle vector, pTY, usingtransformation-associated recombination (TAR) strategy. Infectivity of cDNAclones of CiMV RNA1 and RNA2 was examined in multiple citrus varieties viaAgrobacterium-mediated vacuum-infiltration (AVI) through symptom observation,RT-PCR, and virion detection with an electron microscope. Furthermore, thegenome-sized RT-PCR fragments of RNA1 and RNA2 were obtained from symptomaticJinchengyou (Citrus grandis) plants infected by the cloned virus (CiMV211). Inaddition, CiMV211 produced typical symptoms of wild-type CiMV in cowpea (Vignaangularis) plants inoculated by Agrobacterium-mediated injection. This is thefirst report of infectious cDNA clones of CiMV, which may lay the foundation for research on the pathogenesis and vectorization of the virus.

AB  - Bone tissue engineering, as an alternative for common available therapeuticapproaches, has been developed to focus on reconstructing of the missing tissues and restoring their functionality. In this work, three-dimensional (3D)nanocomposite scaffolds of polycaprolactone-polyethyleneglycol-polycaprolactone/gelatin (PCEC/Gel) were prepared by freeze-drying method.Biocompatible nanohydroxyapatite (nHA), iron oxide nanoparticle (Fe3O4) andhalloysite nanotube (HNT) powders were added to the polymer matrix aiming tocombine the osteogenic activity of nHA or Fe3O4 with high mechanical strength of HNT. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) methods was utilized to characterize the nanotube morphology of HNT as well as nanoparticles of Fe3O4 and nHA.Prepared scaffolds were characterized via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and SEM methods. In addition, thephysical behavior of scaffolds was evaluated to explore the influence of HNT onthe physicochemical properties of composites. Cell viability and attachment were investigated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide) assay and SEM on human dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells(h-DPSCs) in-vitro. Cell proliferation was observed without any cytotoxicityeffect on h-DPSCs for all examined scaffolds. Alizarin red (ARS) and alkalinephosphatase (ALP) staining were carried out to determine the osteoconductivity ofscaffolds. The data demonstrated that all PCEC/Gel/HNT hydrogel scaffoldssupported osteoblast differentiation of hDPSCs with moderate effects on cellproliferation. Moreover, PCEC/Gel/HNT/nHA with proper mechanical strength showed better biological activity compared to PCEC/Gel/HNT/Fe3O4 and PCEC/Gel/HNTscaffolds. Therefore, this study suggested that with proper fillers content,PCEC/Gel/HNT nanocomposite hydrogels alone or in a complex with nHA, Fe3O4 could be a suitable candidate for hard tissue regeneration.

TI  - Differences in the characteristics and pulmonary toxicity of nano- andmicron-sized respirable coal dust.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/s12931-022-02120-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The characteristics of coal dust (CD) particles affect the inhalationof CD, which causes coal worker's pneumoconiosis (CWP). CD nanoparticles (CD-NPs,< 500 nm) and micron particles (CD-MPs, < 5 mum) are components of the respirableCD. However, the differences in physicochemical properties and pulmonary toxicitybetween CD-NPs and CD-MPs remain unclear. METHODS: CD was analyzed by scanningelectron microscopy, Malvern nanoparticle size potentiometer, energy dispersivespectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonancespectroscopy. CCK-8 assay, ELISA, transmission electron microscope, JC-1staining, reactive oxygen species activity probe, calcium ion fluorescent probe, AO/EB staining, flow cytometry, and western blot were used to determine thedifferences between CD-NPs and CD-MPs on acute pulmonary toxicity. CCK-8, scratchhealing and Transwell assay, hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining,immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blot were applied toexamine the effects of CD-NPs and CD-MPs on pneumoconiosis. RESULTS: Analysis of the size distribution of CD revealed that the samples had been size segregated.The carbon content of CD-NPs was greater than that of CD-MPs, and the oxygen,aluminum, and silicon contents were less. In in vitro experiments with A549 andBEAS-2B cells, CD-NPs, compared with CD-MPs, had more inflammatory vacuoles,release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta, TNFalpha) and profibrotic cytokines (CXCL2, TGFbeta1), mitochondrial damage (reactive oxygen species andCa(2+) levels and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential), and cell death(apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necrosis). CD-NPs-induced fibrosis model cells hadstronger proliferation, migration, and invasion than did CD-MPs. In in vivoexperiments, lung coefficient, alveolar inflammation score, and lung tissuefibrosis score (mean: 1.1%, 1.33, 1.33) of CD-NPs were higher than those ofCD-MPs (mean: 1.3%, 2.67, 2.67). CD-NPs accelerated the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by upregulating the expression of pro-fibrotic proteins and promotingepithelial-mesenchymal transition. The regulatory molecules involved wereE-cadherin, N-cadherin, COL-1, COL-3, ZO-1, ZEB1, Slug, alpha-SMA, TGFbeta1, and Vimentin. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation with CD-NPs resulted in more pronounced acute and chronic lung toxicity than did stimulation with CD-MPs. These effectsincluded acute inflammatory response, mitochondrial damage, pyroptosis, andnecrosis, and more pulmonary fibrosis induced by epithelial-mesenchymaltransition.

AB  - Milk is one of the most important multicomponent superfoods owing to its richmacronutrient composition. It requires quality control at all the productionstages from the farm to the finished products. A localized surface plasmonresonance optical sensor based on a citrate-capped silver nanoparticle(Cit-AgNP)-coated glass substrate was developed. The fabrication of such sensors involved a single-step synthesis of Cit-AgNPs followed by surface modification ofglass slides to be coated with the nanoparticles. The scanning electronmicroscope micrographs demonstrated that the nanoparticles formed monolayerislands on glass slides. The developed surface-enhanced infrared absorptionspectroscopy (SEIRA) sensor was coupled to artificial neural networking (ANN) forthe qualitative differentiation between cow, camel, goat, buffalo, and infants'formula powdered milk types. Moreover, it can be used for the quantitativedetermination of the main milk components such as fat, casein, urea, and lactose in each milk type. The qualitative results showed that the obtained FTIR spectra of cow and buffalo milk have high similarity, whereas camel milk resembled infantformula powdered milk. The most difference in FTIR characteristics was evidenced in the case of goat milk. The developed sensor adds several advantages over thetraditional techniques of milk analysis using MilkoScan such as less generatedwaste, elimination of pre-treatment steps, minimal sample volume, low operationtime, and on-site analysis.

AB  - The planktonic diversity throughout the oceans is vital to ecosystem functioning and linked to environmental change. Plankton monitoring tools have advancedconsiderably with high-throughput in-situ digital cameras and genomic sequencing,opening new challenges for high-frequency observations of community composition, structure, and species discovery. Here, we combine multi-marker metabarcodingbased on nuclear 18S (V4) and plastidial 16S (V4-V5) rRNA gene amplicons with adigital in-line holographic microscope to provide a synoptic diversity survey of eukaryotic plankton along the Newfoundland Shelf (Canada) during the wintertransition phase of the North Atlantic bloom phenomenon. Metabarcoding revealed arich eukaryotic diversity unidentifiable in the imaging samples, confirming thepresence of ecologically important saprophytic protists which were unclassifiablein matching images, and detecting important groups unobserved or taxonomicallyunresolved during similar sequencing campaigns in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.In turn, imaging analysis provided quantitative observations of widely prevalent plankton from every trophic level. Despite contrasting plankton compositionsportrayed by each sampling method, both capture broad spatial differences betweenthe northern and southern sectors of the Newfoundland Shelf and suggestcomplementary estimations of important features in eukaryotic assemblages. Futuretasks will involve standardizing digital imaging and metabarcoding for wider use and consistent, comparable ocean observations.

AB  - Nano- and micro-plastic (NMP) pollution has emerged as a global issue; however,uptake in the blood is controversial. Also, there is no evidence that NMPs areexcreted via urine. This study was designed to clarify the time course of NMPsabsorption in blood and the excretion in urine. Male mice received a singleadministration of fluorescent polystyrene (PS) beads (100-nm and 3-mum) via tail vein injection, gavage, or pulmonary perfusion. Blood and urine samples weremeasured 0.5, 1, 2, and 4h after exposure by confocal laser scanning microscope(CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to corroborate thefindings. Fluorescence particles were detected in both blood and urine from the100-nm and 3-mum PS-treated groups after exposure. In the 3-mum PS treated group,particles with corresponding diameters were detected after intravenous injection and pulmonary perfusion, and particles with a diameter <3mum were detected inblood samples after gavage. The fluorescent signal in urine was particularly weakand the size was <3mum. Significant time course changes in fluorescence intensitywere demonstrated in blood and urine (P<0.05) after intravenous injection andpulmonary perfusion in the 100-nm PS-treated group. By contrast, significantchanges were detected in the urine (P<0.05), but not the blood, after gavage. TEMconfirmed the presence of particles with corresponding diameters in bloodsamples; however, the excretion in urine was difficult to confirm fornano-plastics (NPs) and micro-plastics (MPs) because all particles with diametersof approximately 100nm and 3mum had irregular shapes and no clear boundaries. Ourfindings revealed that both NPs and MPs enter the blood circulation throughdigestive and respiratory pathways. Both 100-nm and 3-mum NMPs may be excretedthrough urine, but further evidence is needed. The physical and chemicalproperties of MPs may be impacted by digestive processes in vivo.

AB  - The results of a quantitative analysis of asbestos content in the ground withvarying degrees of concentration of this mineral as a result of natural phenomenasuch as rock weathering, contamination by the manufacture of asbestos and cement products, and the many years of use of "eternit roofs" are presented. Preliminarythermal treatment, soil grinding and sieving were used for the determinations,followed by electrostatic separation in order to obtain the concentration ofasbestos in a smaller volume. It was used for microscopic preparations for theidentification and planimetry of asbestos. A polarizing optical microscope wasused in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The levels of re-emission ofasbestos dust into the air as a result of the exploitation of contaminated soilwere estimated. Polluted land in industrially areas, at a distance of up to1200m, contains 0.0003% to 0.02% asbestos. The content of 0.01% asbestos does notrequire remediation in the absence of soil use. It may cause <500 fibres/m(3).Removing the facade of asbestos-cement panels from the building at a distance of up to 10m resulted in concentration <0.007% of free asbestos in the ground, andfor used roofs <0.001% from above the distance of 3m. This means that land in thevicinity of buildings with facade or roofing made of a-c products can be safelyexploited. The direct discharge of rainwater from the gutter into the ground,however, contaminates it well above this value and those places should be treatedas hazardous waste due to the presence of asbestos fibres in unbound form,containing <9,8%. Ultimately, the size of the threat depends on many factors and can be comparable with the pollution of industrial production.

AB  - Over the past few decades, there have been significant advances in maleinfertility, particularly in the development of novel diagnostic tools.Unfortunately, there remains a substantial number of patients that remaininfertile despite these improvements. In this review, we take heed of theemerging technologies that will shape the future of male infertility diagnosis,evaluation and treatment. Improvement in computer-assisted semen analyses andportability allow males to obtain basic semen parameters from the comfort oftheir home. Additionally, breakthrough ultrasound technology allows forpreoperative prediction of potential areas of spermatogenesis within the testes, high-resolution optics permits better visualization during microdissectiontesticular sperm extraction (mTESE), and artificial intelligence improves spermselection and identification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) - precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)- is utilized in fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) of high-grade gliomas. PpIX isused to identify traces of glioma during resection. Visual inspection of thefluorescence seems inaccurate in comparison to optic techniques such ashyperspectral imaging (HSI). AIM: To characterize the limits of PpIX fluorescencedetection of (i) visual evaluation and (ii) HSI analysis and to (iii) develop aclassification system for visible and non-visible PpIX fluorescence. METHODS:Samples with increasing concentrations (C) of PpIX and non-fluorescent controlswere evaluated using a surgical microscope under blue light illumination. Similarsamples were imaged with a HSI system tuned to PpIX fluorescence peak wavelength (635 nm) and control (RGB) channels. Samples' intensities were defined, leadingto 96 analysed pixels after batching. RESULTS: Three expert neurosurgeonsassessed the PpIX samples (n = 16) and controls (n = 8) with unanimous decisions (ICC = 0.704), resulting in 63% recognition rate, 48% sensitivity, 92%specificity, 92% positive predictive value (PPV) and 47% negative predictivevalue (NPV). HSI image analysis, comparing mean relative values, resulted in 96%,100%, 86%, 94%, 100%, respectively. Minimum PpIX concentration detection forexperts was 0.6-1.8 mumol/l and HSI's 0.03-0.15 mumol/l. CONCLUSIONS: PpIXconcentrations of low-grade gliomas, and those reported on glioblastomainfiltration zones, are below experts' detection threshold. HSI analysis exceeds the performance of expert's visual inspection nearly by 20-fold. Hybrid FGS-HSIsystems should be investigated in parallel to long-term outcomes. Describedmethods are applicable as a standard for calibration, testing and development of subvisual FGS techniques.

AB  - Nitazoxanide is an antimicrobial compound that was originally developed as anantiprotozoal drug. Recently nitazoxanide has been identified as broad-spectrumantiviral agent and redirected for the remediation of some respiratory tractviral infections. In this study, the spectrofluorimetric technique has beenapplied to determine Nitazoxanide (NTX) in tablets or its metabolite, tizoxanide (TZD), in human urine samples. The developed methodology is based on oxidizingNTX (non-fluorescence) into a highly fluorescent product by sodium hypochlorite. The fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 436.5 nm after fluorescenceexcitation at 362.5 nm. After optimizing all conditions, the analyticalprocedures and bio-analytical steps were evaluated and validated using ICH andFDA criteria, respectively. The method linearity, LOQ, and LOD values of NTX were1.0-5.0 microg/mL, 0.434, and 0.143 microg/mL, respectively. The other noveltyside of the presented work is the application of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4)nanoparticles (NPs) as a magnetic solid-phase for the pre-concentration andextraction process. The synthesized magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope and zeta sizer techniques. Finally, the utilizedmagnetic nanoparticles exhibited good recovery results for pre-concentration and extraction of NTX or its metabolite from spiked and real human urine samples,respectively.

TI  - Engineering the Acoustic Response and Drug Loading Capacity of PBCA-BasedPolymeric Microbubbles with Surfactants.
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00416 [doi]
AB  - Gas-filled microbubbles (MB) are routinely used in the clinic as ultrasoundcontrast agents. MB are also increasingly explored as drug delivery vehiclesbased on their ultrasound stimuli-responsiveness and well-established shellfunctionalization routes. Broadening the range of MB properties can enhance theirperformance in both imaging and drug delivery applications. This can be promoted by systematically varying the reagents used in the synthesis of MB, which in the case of polymeric MB include surfactants. We therefore set out to study theeffect of key surfactant characteristics, such as the chemical structure,molecular weight, and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance on the formation ofpoly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) MB, as well as on their properties, includingshell thickness, drug loading capacity, ultrasound contrast, and acousticstability. Two different surfactant families (i.e., Triton X and Tween) wereemployed, which show opposite molecular weight vs hydrophilic-lipophilic balance trends. For both surfactant types, we found that the shell thickness of PBCA MBincreased with higher-molecular-weight surfactants and that the resulting MB withthicker shells showed higher drug loading capacities and acoustic stability.Furthermore, the higher proportion of smaller polymer chains of the TritonX-based MB (as compared to those of the Tween-based ones) resulted in lowerpolymer entanglement, improving drug loading capacity and ultrasound contrastresponse. These findings open up new avenues to fine-tune the shell properties ofpolymer-based MB for enhanced ultrasound imaging and drug delivery applications.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271056 [doi]
AB  - The cell nucleus is a dynamic structure that changes locales during cellularprocesses such as proliferation, differentiation, or migration, and itsmispositioning is a hallmark of several disorders. As with most mechanobiologicalactivities of adherent cells, the repositioning and anchoring of the nucleus are presumed to be associated with the organization of the cytoskeleton, the network of protein filaments providing structural integrity to the cells. However,demonstrating this correlation between cytoskeleton organization and nuclearposition requires the parameterization of the extraordinarily intricatecytoskeletal fiber arrangements. Here, we show that this parameterization anddemonstration can be achieved outside the limits of human conceptualization,using generative network and raw microscope images, relying on machine-driveninterpretation and selection of parameterizable features. The developedtransformer-based architecture was able to generate high-quality, completedimages of more than 8,000 cells, using only information on actin filaments,predicting the presence of a nucleus and its exact localization in more than 70per cent of instances. Our results demonstrate one of the most basic principlesof mechanobiology with a remarkable level of significance. They also highlightthe role of deep learning as a powerful tool in biology beyond data augmentation and analysis, capable of interpreting-unconstrained by the principles of humanreasoning-complex biological systems from qualitative data.

TI  - Hybrid Graphene-Supported Aluminum Plasmonics.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c01730 [doi]
AB  - Controlled fabrication of devices for plasmonics on suspended graphene enablesobtaining tunable localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), reducing thered-shift of LSPRs, and creating hybrid 3D-2D systems promising for adjustabledipole-dipole coupling and plasmon-mediated catalysis. Here, we apply a low-cost fabrication methodology to produce patterned aluminum nanostructures (bowties andtetramers) on graphene monolayers via electron-beam lithography and trap platinum(Pt) nanoclusters (NCs) within their hotspots by thermal annealing. We reveal theLSPRs of aluminum plasmonics on graphene using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) in amonochromated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The LSPRs ofthese nanostructures are measured to be between visible and ultraviolet regionsof the spectrum and are confirmed by electromagnetic simulations. The antibondingdipole and bonding dipole modes of both structures are tuned by controlling theirgap size. The tetramers enable the simultaneous excitation of both antibondingand bonding dipole modes at the poles of nanoprisms, while bowties allow us toexcite these modes separately either at the poles or within the hotspot. Wefurther show that the hybrid nanocavity-NC systems are in the intermediatecoupling regime providing an enhanced plasmon absorption in the Pt NCs via theenergy transfer from the antibonding dipole mode to the Pt NCs. The dipole LSPRof Pt NCs also couples to the bonding-type breathing mode in bowties. Ourfindings suggest that these hybrid nanocavity-graphene systems are of highapplication potential for plasmon-mediated catalysis, surface-enhancedfluorescence, and quantum technologies.

TI  - Rotational Load Fatigue Performance of Titanium vs Titanium-ZirconiumImplant-Abutment Connections.
PG  - 740-747
LID - 10.11607/jomi.9260 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Titanium-zirconium (Ti-Zr) alloy has been developed to strengthen theimplant body, but clinically relevant information is still limited. The aim ofthis in vitro study was to compare the rotational load fatigue performance ofimplant-abutment connections in narrow-diameter (3.3-mm) and regular-diameter(4.1-mm) implants made with commercially pure grade 4 titanium alloy (CPTi-G4)and Ti-Zr. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Narrow-diameter (N) and regular-diameter (R)implants with CPTi-G4 (Ti) or Ti-Zr (Tz) materials were tested. This resulted in four test groups: NTi, NTz, RTi and RTz. Five specimens were made for each group (n = 5). Abutments used were milled from titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy abutmentblanks. A rotational load fatigue machine applied a sinusoidally varying load at an angle of 45 degrees to produce an effective bending moment of 35 Ncm at afrequency of 14 Hz in air at 20 degrees C. The number of cycles to failure wasrecorded. The upper limit was set as 5 million cycles. Results were evaluatedusing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post hoc tests. Failure locationsand patterns were evaluated with scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: Allregular-diameter test groups reached the upper limit of 5 million cycles without failure. All narrow-diameter test groups failed within the range of 402,530cycles to 3,374,353 cycles. It could be observed that NTz showed a higher meancycle count as compared to NTi. NTi test group recorded two implants damaged, oneimplant fracture, five abutment fractures, and four screw fractures. NTz testgroup showed only abutment fractures at the level of implant platform, with nodamage to the implant bodies. Significant difference was found between implantsof different diameters. There was no significant difference between implants ofdifferent materials. CONCLUSION: Regular-diameter implants performedsignificantly better than narrow-diameter implants, regardless of material, whileno significant difference in cyclic load to failure was found between groups ofdifferent alloys. All NTz failures were at the abutment only, without damage tothe implant. This failure pattern can potentially be clinically advantageous interms of retrieval and subsequent replacement of a failed prosthesis.

TI  - Anti-bacterial and arsenic remediation insights in aqueous systems ontoheterogeneous metal oxide (Cu0.52Al0.1Fe0.47O4)/rGO hybrid: an approach towardsairborne microbial degradation.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22169-8 [doi]
AB  - Copper-based ternary metal oxide (i.e., Cu0.52Al0.01Fe0.47O4) impregnated reducedgraphene oxide nanohybrid is verified for microbial and arsenic treatment. Growthinhibition of colonies are observed around 99.99% (E. coli), and 99.83% (S.aureus) at 10-20 mug/mL of hybrid dosage, respectively. The inhibition rates for both the colonies are increased to 99.9998% at 80 mug/mL. TEM images have showninsight of cell-content/lipid leakage behavior after inoculating with the hybrid.The efficient hindrance towards microbial colony growth is attributed to bettercharge transfer, reactive oxygen species generation, and metal-ion release.Maximum arsenic sorption capacities are observed around 248 and 314 mg/g forAs(III), and As(V), respectively (Ci ~ 500 ppm). Surface morphology studies onto arsenic adsorption are reported with atomic force microscope, and FT-IR/Ramananalysis. A detailed discussion onto individual spectra of As 3d spectraconfirmed the occurrence of redox transformation in arsenic species [As(III)].The variation in the quantity (at. %) of oxygen functional groups in O1s spectra (i.e., M-O, M-OH, and -OH2) onto the hybrid supported the ligand-exchangebehavior. Cyclic voltammetry study in arsenic electrolytes (10 microM - 1 mM)provides the occurrence of various in-situ electrochemical reactions supportingthe redox activity. A significant electromagnetic wave absorption characteristicsof the present hybrid is proposed with plausible airborne antimicrobial-agentabilities.

TI  - Antibacterial and Anti-inflammatory Activity of Extracts and Major ConstituentsDerived from Stachytarpheta indica Linn. Leaves and Their Potential Implications for Wound Healing.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-021-03635-4 [doi]
AB  - Wounds of various types continue to have a severe socioeconomic impact on thecost of health care. Globally, there has been increased interest surrounding the identification of bioactive compounds that promote or modulate the wound healing process. Stachytarpheta indica Linn. is traditionally used to heal wounds andrelieve inflammation; however, the theorised pharmacological properties have not yet been scientifically validated. In this study, dried and ground plant leaveswere extracted with water and methanol, which were then subjected to variousanalyses. The antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts and isolated compoundswas determined using well diffusion assays, while the minimum inhibitoryconcentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay. Morphological changesof human keratinocytes in response to plant extracts were observed withdifferential interference contrast microscope imaging. Cell viability,proliferation, and migratory effects post-treatment with the plant extracts were also evaluated via colorimetric cytotoxicity assays and a real-time cell analyserprotocol. Anti-inflammatory effects of plant extracts and isolated compounds wereevaluated by flow cytometry and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitionassays. Three active compounds, i.e. ipolamiide, verbascoside andiso-verbascoside, were isolated from S. indica leaves. Verbascoside demonstrated broad-range antibacterial activity and imposed strong inhibition at 9.77 mug/mLagainst Staphylococci spp. S. indica extracts (0.1-0.2 mg/mL) were shown toimprove human keratinocyte proliferation up to 60% and induce morphologicalchanges by producing cytoplasmic projections at concentrations higher than 0.4mg/mL. Plant extracts (6.25-100 mug/mL) and individual compounds (3.125-50mug/mL) elicited strong anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the expressionof interleukin-8 and inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes.Collectively, these results indicate that plant extracts and isolated compoundsderived from S. indica have the potential to inhibit bacterial growth, promotetissue regeneration and reduce inflammation, hence, potentially providing thebasis for a novel therapeutic for the treatment of wounds.

AB  - This study focused on the problem of projection parameter search in 3Dreconstruction using single-particle analysis. We treated the samplingdistribution for the parameter search as a prior distribution and designed aprobabilistic model for efficient parameter estimation. Using our method, weshowed that it is possible to perform 3D reconstruction from synthetic and actualelectron microscope images using an initial model, and to generate the initialmodel itself. We also examined whether the optimization function used in thestochastic gradient descent method can be applied with loose constraints toimprove the convergence of initial model generation and confirmed the effect. In order to investigate the advantage of generating a smooth sampling distributionfrom the stochastic model, we compared the distribution of estimated projectiondirections with the conventional method of performing a global search usingspherical gridding. As a result, our method, which is simple in both mathematicalmodel and implementation, showed no algorithmic artifacts.

AB  - Atomic defects are critical to tuning the physical and chemical properties offunctional materials such as catalysts, semiconductors, and 2D materials.However, direct structural characterization of atomic defects, especially theirformation and annihilation under practical conditions, is challenging yet crucialto understanding the underlying mechanisms driving defect dynamics, which remain mostly elusive. Here, through in situ atomic imaging by an aberration-correctedenvironmental transmission electron microscope (AC-ETEM), we directly visualizethe formation and annihilation mechanism of planar defects in monoclinic WO3 onthe atomic scale in real time. We captured the atomistic process of thenucleation dynamics of the dislocation core in the [010] direction, followed byits propagation to form a planar defect. Corroborated by density functionaltheory-based calculations, we rationalize the formation of dislocation through O extraction from bridge sites followed by an atomic channeling process. These insitu observations shed light on the defect dynamics in oxides and provide atomic insights into forming and manipulating defects in functional materials.

LID - e78079 [pii]
AB  - Human cerebral organoids are unique in their development of progenitor-rich zonesakin to ventricular zones from which neuronal progenitors differentiate andmigrate radially. Analyses of cerebral organoids thus far have been performed in sectioned tissue or in superficial layers due to their high scatteringproperties. Here, we demonstrate label-free three-photon imaging of whole,uncleared intact organoids (~2 mm depth) to assess early events of early humanbrain development. Optimizing a custom-made three-photon microscope to imageintact cerebral organoids generated from Rett Syndrome patients, we show defects in the ventricular zone volumetric structure of mutant organoids compared toisogenic control organoids. Long-term imaging live organoids reveals that shortermigration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migratingneurons are associated with more tortuous trajectories. Our label-free imagingsystem constitutes a particularly useful platform for tracking normal andabnormal development in individual organoids, as well as for screeningtherapeutic molecules via intact organoid imaging.

PG  - 730-735
LID - 10.3724/SP.J.1123.2022.03008 [doi]
AB  - A polymer-based strong anion stationary phase modified by quaternary ammoniatedallyl glycidyl ether (AGE) for ion chromatography (IC) was developed. It wasprepared by surface copolymerization between AGE and the pedant double bondsassociated with hydrolyzed poly(glycidylmethacrylate-divinylbenzene) (GMA-DVB)substrate, followed by quaternization with N,N-methyldiethanolamine (a tertiaryamine, MDEA). The synthesis conditions were optimized, including the type oforganic tertiary amines (MDEA, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, trimethylamine),substrate hydrolysis, the amount of monomer and initiator, reaction temperatureand reaction time. The obtained anion stationary phase was characterized byscanning electron microscope and elemental analysis. MDEA was observed to be the best quaternization reagent since the anion exchanger obtained by such reagentshowed good separation and suitable retention time towards model inorganicanions. The resulting reason probably lies in higher hydrophilicity of MDEArelative the other two ones. The use of rich epoxy groups of GMA-DVB to introducethe functional groups was commonly used in many previous reports. Here the epoxy groups were firstly hydrolyzed to be diol groups and the pendant double bondsonto the surface of GMA-DVB particles were used to graft AGE. The data achievedindicated that the use of hydrolyzed GMA-DVB substrate would be helpful to reduceanion exchange capacity and unwanted non-ion exchange interaction, in which therich epoxy groups were converted to hydroxy groups. More important, the obtained anion exchanger after hydrolytic treatment could offer a significantly reduction of retention time (~68%) and a ~1.67-fold higher plate count (take Br(-) as anexample). The apparent capacity of the phase was computed to be 264 mumol/g bycontent of N data and its effective capacity was measured to be 98.5 mumol/columnby the breakthrough curve method. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions,the obtained stationary phase showed baseline separation of seven commoninorganic anions in less than 13 min using carbonate-bicarbonate mixed eluent,exhibiting high separation efficiency and peak shape, e. g. 49000 plate/m and38000 plate/m of the theoretical plate counts respectively for chloride andnitrate, and their asymmetric factor were 1.3 and 1.4. These can be comparable orslightly higher than those of commercial columns. The fitted equation of theeluent concentration and the retention factors of model anions was proved thation exchange model dominates the retention mechanism of the anion stationaryphase. This offers a simple way to prepare anion exchanger and to manipulateanion exchange capacity. The utility of the obtained anion exchanger has beendemonstrated to the analysis of tap water.

PG  - 920252
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.920252 [doi]
AB  - Background: An exoscope heralds a new era of optics in surgery. However, there islimited quantitative evidence describing and comparing the learning curve.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the learning curve, plateau, and rateof novice surgeons using an Olympus ORBEYE exoscope compared to an operatingmicroscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI PENTERO or KINEVO 900). Methods: A preclinical,randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial assessed the performance of seventeennovice and seven expert surgeons completing the microsurgical grape dissectiontask "Star's the limit." A standardized star was drawn on a grape using a stencilwith a 5 mm edge length. Participants cut the star and peeled the star-shapedskin off the grape with microscissors and forceps while minimizing damage to the grape flesh. Participants repeated the task 20 times consecutively for eachoptical device. Learning was assessed using model functions such as the Weibullfunction, and the cognitive workload was assessed with the NASA Task Load Index(NASA-TLX). Results: Seventeen novice (male:female 12:5; median years of training0.4 [0-2.8 years]) and six expert (male:female 4:2; median years of training 10[8.9-24 years]) surgeons were recruited. "Star's the limit" was validated using aperformance score that gave a threshold of expert performance of 70 (0-100). The learning rate (ORBEYE -0.94 +/- 0.37; microscope -1.30 +/- 0.46) and learningplateau (ORBEYE 64.89 +/- 8.81; microscope 65.93 +/- 9.44) of the ORBEYE weresignificantly noninferior compared to those of the microscope group (p = 0.009; p= 0.027, respectively). The cognitive workload on NASA-TLX was higher for theORBEYE. Novices preferred the freedom of movement and ergonomics of the ORBEYEbut preferred the visualization of the microscope. Conclusions: This is the firststudy to quantify the ORBEYE learning curve and the first randomized controlledtrial to compare the ORBEYE learning curve to that of the microscope. The plateauperformance and learning rate of the ORBEYE are significantly noninferior tothose of the microscope in a preclinical grape dissection task. This study alsosupports the ergonomics of the ORBEYE as reported in preliminary observationalstudies and highlights visualization as a focus for further development.

PG  - 936255
LID - 10.3389/fchem.2022.936255 [doi]
AB  - The Mueller matrix contains abundant micro- and even nanostructural informationof media. Especially, it can be used as a powerful tool to characterizeanisotropic structures quantitatively, such as the particle size, density, andorientation information of fibers in the sample. Compared with unpolarizedmicroscopic imaging techniques, Mueller matrix microscopy can also obtain someessential structural information about the sample from the derived parametersimages at low resolution. Here, to analyze the comprehensive effects of imagingresolution on polarization properties obtained from the Mueller matrix, we,first, measure the microscopic Mueller matrices of unstained rat dorsal skintissue slices rich in collagen fibers using a series of magnifications ornumerical aperture (NA) values of objectives. Then, the first-order moments andimage texture parameters are quantified and analyzed in conjunction with thepolarization parameter images. The results show that the Mueller matrix polardecomposition parameters diattenuation D, linear retardance delta, anddepolarization Delta images obtained using low NA objective retain most of thestructural information of the sample and can provide fast imaging speed. Inaddition, the scattering phase function analysis and Monte Carlo simulation basedon the cylindrical scatterers reveal that the diattenuation parameter D imageswith different imaging resolutions are expected to be used to distinguish amongthe fibrous scatterers in the medium with different particle sizes. This studyprovides a criterion to decide which structural information can be accurately andrapidly obtained using a transmission Mueller matrix microscope with low NAobjectives to assist pathological diagnosis and other applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck) is an adaptorprotein, which is ubiquitously expressed in many types of cells. In T cells, the Nck1 isoform promotes T cell receptor signalling as well as actin polymerisation.However, the role of Nck1 in the lipid metabolism in T cells is unknown. In thepresent study, we investigated the effect of the Nck1 protein and Nck-CD3interaction on lipid metabolism and on the physical and biological properties of Jurkat T cells, using a newly developed holotomographic microscope. RESULTS:Holotomographic microscopy showed that Nck1-knocked-out cells had membrane blebs and were irregular in shape compared to the rounded control cells. The cell size and volume of Nck1-deficient cells were comparable to those of the control cells.Nck1-knocked-out Jurkat T cells had a greater lipid content, lipid mass/cell massratio, and lipid metabolite levels than the control cells. Interestingly,treatment with a small molecule, AX-024, which inhibited Nck-CD3 interaction,also caused an increase in the lipid content in wild-type Jurkat T cells, asfound in Nck1-deficient cells. CONCLUSIONS: Knockout of Nck1 protein andhindrance of the Nck-CD3 interaction cause the elevation of lipid content inJurkat T cells.

AB  - This paper investigated the preparation method and the dispersion behaviour ofModified Carbon Nanotube-fiber Reinforcements (MCNF), the change laws and theeffect mechanisms of dynamic compressive strength of MCNF concretes.Electrophoresis method was used to prepare MCNF and its interfacial shearperformance was tested by interfacial shear strength (IFSS) test. In addition,the dispersion behavior of MCNF in simulated concrete solution was verified byturbidity method. Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), Scanning ElectronMicroscope (SEM) and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) tests were carried onconcrete samples with different volume fractions (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%) of MCNF. The results show that carbon nanotubes are easier to deposit to thenegative electrode, and the higher the content of polycarboxylatesuperplasticizer, the more obvious the dispersity of MCNF in alkalineenvironment. The dynamic compressive strength of MCNF concrete was 14.0-35.5%higher than that of untreated concrete, and reached the maximum when the MCNFcontent was about 0.3%. The MCNF was wrapped in concrete matrix and promotedhydration reaction of interface between cement and MCNF from microscopicobservation. The addition of MCNF could increase the porosity. The volumepercentage of >/= 100 nm pore decreased first and then increased. Reasons for theimprovement strength of MCNF concrete is that the bridging effect is strongerwith the increase of MCNF content (</= 0.3%) and limited when the MCNF content isequal to 0.4%. MCNF concrete could be used in actual engineering with highrequirements for dynamic load.

TI  - Effect of printing orientation and post-curing time on the flexural strength of3D-printed resins.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13572 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of printing orientation combined with differentpost-curing times on the flexural strength of 3D-printed resins. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: A total of 480 rectangular specimens with the dimensions of 64x10x3.3 mmwere designed and fabricated from two 3D printed acrylic resins and oneheat-polymerized resin (HP). 3D-printed groups were divided into 3 groupsaccording to printing orientations (0-, 45-, 90-degree); each group wassubdivided into 4 groups according to post-curing time (30, 60, 90, 120 min.).All specimens were subjected to thermal cycling (10,000 cycles) before testingflexural strength. Fractured surfaces were examined under scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test were used for data analysis(alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The result of this study showed that the highestflexural strength values of 3D-printed resin (NextDent, and ASIGA) were in0-degree groups. Also, the flexural strength values increased when post-curingtime was increased regardless of the printing orientation and the highestflexural strength was recorded at 120 min post-curing time in all orientations.SEM analysis showed rougher surface with irregular lamellae which represented aductile fracture confirming that high energy is required for crack propagationand these features markedly increased as post-curing time increased. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the 0-degree orientation groups showed higher flexuralstrength compared to other groups. Similarly, with increased post-curing time,the flexural strength increased. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

AB  - Precise delivery of hydrophobic drugs has always been a great challenge for drug delivery systems. To overcome this problem, we designed and synthesized a novelsupramolecular host biotin-acyclic cucurbituril (ACBB) at the first time, and we have developed a host-guest amphiphilic complex based on ACBB andamantadine-conjugated cannabinoids (AD-CBD) that self-assembles to formfunctionalized supramolecular micelles (FSMs) for cell-targeted drug delivery.The 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of the amphiphilic complex and its possiblehost-guest inclusion behaviors are obtained by fluorescence titration, nuclearmagnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) andthermal analysis (TGA and DSC). Using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), we have observed that the shape of FSMs wasspherical and size was 137-192 nm. In addition, MTT test results show that FSMshave good antitumor activity, taking MCF-7 as an example, the in vitrohalf-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of FSMs were 1.53 muM and5.02 muM, which were better than 30.83 muM of cisplatin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results showed that FSMs loaded with Rhodamine B canspecifically aggregate on the surface of tumor cells and the targeting abilityhas been directly verified. Flow cytometry results showed that FSMs could promotetumor cell apoptosis. All results indicated that FSMs had high bioavailability,stability, accurate targeting and excellent delivery efficiency, which had great application potential in the field of drug delivery.

AB  - We report a patient who developed reactivated toxoplasmic encephalitis due tohuman immunodeficiency (HIV)-associated immune compromise, resulting in abreakdown of the balance between the host immunity and toxoplasma cyst. Throughdetailed pathological analysis, spilling of tachyzoites from the ruptured wall oftoxoplasma cyst can be identified. It was also proved that Toxoplasma gondiiwould infect endothelial cells of blood vessels, leading to vasculitis and brain ischemic necrosis. By transmission electron microscope (TEM), apical complex ofthe parasite can be identified, as well as tachyzoites in rapid reproductionthrough fission. Rhoptry, a club-shaped specialized organelle, which ischaracteristic of the motile stages of Apicomplexa protozoans, was alsoidentified. The prevention of toxoplasma infection is still an issue to beemphasized in public health. This article is special in its pathophysiology-baseddescription of the morphology. 'Form ever follows function' is a famous quotefrom the architect Louis Sullivan. In this case report, we make effort to depict a pathophysiology-based or a 'form-function correlation' interpretation of thehistopathological findings by light microscope, IHC and ultrastructuralexamination. We believe such an approach should also be included in the dailypathology resident training program.

The 50 muL of 0.2 mg/mL GO solution was evenly applied onto the conductive gel, and the structure and size of GO were observed under field emission scanningelectron microscope after drying. Human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) were divided into0 mug/mL GO (without GO solution, the same as below) group, 0.1 mug/mL GO group, 1.0 mug/mL GO group, 5.0 mug/mL GO group, and 10.0 mug/mL GO group treated withGO of the corresponding final mass concentration, and the absorbance value wasdetected using a microplate analyzer after 48 h of culture to reflect theproliferation activity of cells (n=6). HSFs and human umbilical vein vascularendothelial cells (HUVECs) were divided into 0 mug/mL GO group, 0.1 mug/mL GOgroup, 1.0 mug/mL GO group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO group treated with GO of thecorresponding final mass concentration, and the migration rates of HSFs at 24 and36 h after scratching (n=5) and HUVECs at 12 h after scratching (n=3) weredetected by scratch test, and the level of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) secreted by HSFs after 4, 6, and 8 h of culture was detected byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (n=3). The prepared GO-GelMA compositehydrogels containing GO of the corresponding final mass concentration were set as0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, 0.1 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, 1.0mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group toobserve their properties before and after cross-linking, and to detect therelease of GO after soaking with phosphate buffer solution for 3 and 7 d (n=3).The full-thickness skin defect wounds were made on the back of 16 6-week-oldfemale C57BL/6 mice. The mice treated with in situ cross-linked GO-GelMAcomposite hydrogel containing GO of the corresponding final mass concentrationwere divided into 0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, 0.1 mug/mL GO compositehydrogel group, 1.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, and 5.0 mug/mL GOcomposite hydrogel group according to the random number table, with 4 mice ineach group. The general condition of wound was observed and the wound healingrate was calculated on 3, 7, and 14 d of treatment, the wound blood perfusion wasdetected by laser Doppler flowmetry on 3, 7, and 14 d of treatment and the meanperfusion unit (MPU) ratio was calculated, and the wound vascularization on 7 dof treatment was observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining and the vasculardensity was calculated (n=3). The wound tissue of mice in 0 mug/mL GO compositehydrogel group and 0.1 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group on 7 d of treatment wascollected to observe the relationship between the distribution of GO andneovascularization by hematoxylin-eosin staining (n=3) and the expression of VEGFby immunohistochemical staining. Data were statistically analyzed with analysisof variance for repeated measurement, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey'smethod. Results: GO had a multilayered lamellar structure with the width of about20 mum and the length of about 50 mum. The absorbance value of HSFs in 10.0mug/mL GO group was significantly lower than that in 0 mug/mL GO group after 48 hof culture (q=7.64, P<0.01). At 24 h after scratching, the migration rates ofHSFs were similar in the four groups (P>0.05); at 36 h after scratching, themigration rate of HSFs in 0.1 mug/mL GO group was significantly higher than that in 0 mug/mL GO group, 1.0 mug/mL GO group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO group (with q valuesof 7.48, 10.81, and 10.20, respectively, P<0.01). At 12 h after scratching, themigration rate of HUVECs in 0.1 mug/mL GO group was significantly higher thanthat in 0 mug/mL GO group, 1.0 mug/mL GO group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO group (with qvalues of 7.11, 8.99, and 14.92, respectively, P<0.01), and the migration rate ofHUVECs in 5.0 mug/mL GO group was significantly lower than that in 0 mug/mL GOgroup and 1.0 mug/mL GO group (with q values of 7.81 and 5.33, respectively,P<0.05 or P<0.01 ). At 4 and 6 h of culture, the VEGF expressions of HSFs in the four groups were similar (P>0.05); at 8 h of culture, the VEGF expression of HSFsin 0.1 mug/mL GO group was significantly higher than that in 0 mug/mL GO groupand 5.0 mug/mL GO group (with q values of 4.75 and 4.48, respectively, P<0.05).The GO-GelMA composite hydrogels in the four groups were all red liquid beforecross-linking, which turned to light yellow gel after cross-linking, with nosignificant difference in fluidity. The GO in the GO-GelMA composite hydrogel of 0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group had no release of GO at all time points; theGO in the GO-GelMA composite hydrogels of the other 3 groups was partiallyreleased on 3 d of soaking, and all the GO was released on 7 d of soaking. From 3to 14 d of treatment, the wounds of mice in the 4 groups were covered withhydrogel dressings, kept moist, and gradually healed. On 3, 7, and 14 d oftreatment, the wound healing rates of mice in the four groups were similar(P>0.05). On 3 d of treatment, the MPU ratio of wound of mice in 0.1 mug/mL GOcomposite hydrogel group was significantly higher than that in 0 mug/mL GOcomposite hydrogel group, 1.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group (with q values of 10.70, 11.83, and 10.65,respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01). On 7 and 14 d of treatment, the MPU ratios ofwound of mice in the four groups were similar (P>0.05). The MPU ratio of wound ofmice in 0.1 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group on 7 d of treatment wassignificantly lower than that on 3 d of treatment (q=14.38, P<0.05), and that on 14 d of treatment was significantly lower than that on 7 d of treatment (q=27.78,P<0.01). On 7 d of treatment, the neovascular density of wound of mice on 7 d of treatment was 120.7+/-4.1 per 200 times of visual field, which was significantly higher than 61.7+/-1.3, 77.7+/-10.2, and 99.0+/-7.9 per 200 times of visual fieldin 0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, 1.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, and 5.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group (with q values of 12.88, 7.79, and6.70, respectively, P<0.01), and the neovascular density of wound of mice in 1.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group and 5.0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group wassignificantly higher than that in 0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group (with qvalues of 5.10 and 6.19, respectively, P<0.05). On 7 d of treatment, cluster ofnew blood vessels in wound of mice in 0.1 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group was significantly more than that in 0 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group, and the newblood vessels were clustered near the GO; a large amount of VEGF was expressed inwound of mice in 0.1 mug/mL GO composite hydrogel group in the distribution area of GO and new blood vessels. Conclusions: GO with mass concentration lower than10.0 mug/mL had no adverse effect on proliferation activity of HSFs, and GO of0.1 mug/mL can promote the migration of HSFs and HUVECs, and can promote thesecretion of VEGF in HSFs. In situ photopolymerized of GO-GelMA compositehydrogel dressing can promote the wound neovascularization of full-thickness skindefect in mice and increase wound blood perfusion in the early stage, with GOshowing an enrichment effect on angiogenesis, and the mechanism may be related tothe role of GO in promoting the secretion of VEGF by wound cells.

TI  - Determination of thick and thin fibres distribution in Sunda porcupine dorsalskin (Hystrix javanica) using Picrosirius red staining.
LID - 10.1111/ahe.12845 [doi]
AB  - The complexity of the Sunda porcupine skin has become an important topic due tothe unique characteristics of its quill follicles. The structure and chemicalcomposition of the skin has affected many physiological and other conditions.Generally, quills are larger, stronger and stiffer than hair; therefore, the skinstructure needs to adapt to support their physiology. The strength of the skin isdetermined by its collagen composition and arrangement; therefore, this studyaims to analyse the composition and distribution of thick and thin fibres basedon the specific characteristics of Sunda porcupine skin under polarized lightusing picrosirius red staining. The skin samples used were from the thoracodorsaland lumbosacral regions of eight Sunda porcupine adults. The histologicalstaining was carried out using the picrosirius red method, while the samples wereobserved under a polarized light microscope and analysed with software. Theresults showed that the skin is composed of 36%-65% thick fibres, 20%-35% thinfibres and small amounts of other types with the lumbosacral region having highercompositions of thick and thin fibres than those in the thoracodorsal region.Furthermore, the thoracodorsal and lumbosacral regions have the highestcomposition of thick fibre in the deeper dermis and quill follicle, respectively.These demonstrated that the complexity of the skin structure of Sunda porcupinedue to its quill derivates correlated with its collagen composition anddistribution.

AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility on the preparation of novel negativepressure materials for constructing new matrix of full-thickness skin defectwounds in rats. Methods: The experimental research method was applied. Themicrostructure of polyurethane foam dressing which was commonly used in negative pressure treatment was observed under scanning electron microscope, and its pore diameter was detected (n=5). Polycaprolactone (PCL) and polybutylene succinate(PBS) were used respectively as raw materials for the preparation of PCL and PBS negative pressure materials by melt spinning technology, with the measured porediameter of polyurethane foam dressing as the spinning spacing at the spinningrates of 15, 25, and 35 mm/s, respectively. The microstructures of the preparednegative pressure materials were observed under scanning electron microscope, andtheir fiber diameters were measured. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the prepared negative pressure materials and polyurethane foam dressing weremeasured by tensile testing machine and composite testing machine, respectively(n=5), to screen the spinning rate for subsequent preparation of negativepressure materials. Human skin fibroblasts (Fbs) in logarithmic growth phase wereco-cultured with PCL negative pressure material and PBS negative pressurematerial prepared at the selected spinning rate, respectively. After 1, 4, and 7 day (s) of co-culture, the cell activity and adhesion in the materials wasdetected by living/dead cells detection kit, and the cell proliferation level in the materials was detected by cell counting kit 8 method (n=5). A full-thickness skin defect wound was prepared on the back of 18 5-6 weeks old Sprague-Dawleyrats (gender unlimited). Immediately after injury, the injured rats were divided into PCL+polyurethane group, PBS+polyurethane group, and polyurethane alone groupaccording to the random number table (with 6 rats in each group). The wounds werecovered with materials containing corresponding component and performed withcontinuous negative pressure suction at the negative pressure of -16.7 kPa. Thewound tissue along with materials directly contacted to the wound (hereinafterreferred to as wound specimens) were collected from 3 rats in each group after 7 and 14 days of negative pressure treatment (NPT), respectively. The growth ofgranulation tissue and the attachment of material to wound surface were observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining, the collagen fiber deposition was observedafter Masson staining, and CD34 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) positive cells weredetected and counted by immunohistochemical staining. Data were statisticallyanalyzed with one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance for factorialdesign, least significant difference-t test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: The microstructure of polyurethanefoam dressing was loose and porous, with the pore diameter of (815+/-182) mum.The spinning spacing for the subsequent negative pressure material was set as 800mum. The microstructures of PBS negative pressure material and PCL negativepressure material were regular, with vertically interconnected layers andcontinuous fibers in even thickness, but the fibers of PBS negative pressurematerial were straighter than those of PCL negative pressure material. There was no obvious difference in the microstructure of negative pressure materialsprepared from the same raw material at different spinning rates. The fiberdiameters of PCL negative pressure materials prepared at three spinning rateswere similar (P>0.05). The fiber diameters of PBS negative pressure materialsprepared at spinning rates of 25 mm/s and 35 mm/s were significantly smaller thanthe fiber diameter of PBS negative pressure material prepared at the spinningrate of 15 mm/s (with t values of 4.99 and 6.40, respectively, P<0.01). Both the tensile strength and tensile modulus of PCL negative pressure materials prepared at three spinning rates were similar (P>0.05). The tensile strength of PBSnegative pressure materials prepared at spinning rates of 15 mm/s and 25 mm/s wassignificantly lower than that of PBS negative pressure materials prepared at the spinning rate of 35 mm/s (with t values of 9.20 and 8.92, respectively, P<0.01), and the tensile modulus was significantly lower than that of PBS negativepressure materials prepared at the spinning rate of 35 mm/s (with t values of2.58 and 2.47, respectively, P<0.05). Subsequently, PCL negative pressurematerial was prepared at the spinning rate of 35 mm/s, and PBS negative pressure material was prepared at the spinning rate of 15 mm/s. After 1, 4, and 7 day (s) of co-culture, the number of human skin Fbs that adhered to PCL negative pressurematerial and PBS negative pressure material increased with time, and there was nosignificant difference between the two materials. After 1 and 7 day (s) ofco-culture, the proliferation levels of human skin Fbs between the two negativepressure materials were similar (P>0.05). After being co-cultured for 4 days, theproliferation level of human skin Fbs in PBS negative pressure material wassignificantly higher than that in PCL negative pressure material (t=6.37,P<0.01). After 7 days of NPT, the materials were clearly identifiable and a smallamount of collagen fibers were also observed in the wound specimens of rats inthe three groups; a small amount of granulation tissue was observed in the wound specimens of rats in polyurethane alone group. After 14 days of NPT, a largenumber of granulation tissue and collagen fibers were observed in the woundspecimens of rats in the three groups; the materials and wound tissue in thewound specimens of rats in PCL+polyurethane group could not be clearlydistinguished. After 7 and 14 days of NPT, the collagen fibers in the woundspecimens of rats in polyurethane alone group were denser than those in the othertwo groups. After 7 days of NPT, the number of CD34 positive cells in the woundspecimens of rats in PBS+polyurethane group was 14.8+/-3.6 per 400 times visualfield, which was significantly less than 27.8+/-9.1 in polyurethane alone group(t=3.06, P<0.05); the number of IL-6 positive cells was 60 (49, 72), which wassignificantly more than 44 (38, 50) in polyurethane alone group (Z=2.41, P<0.05).After 14 days of NPT, the number of IL-6 positive cells in the wound specimens ofrats in PBS+polyurethane group was 19 (12, 28) per 400 times visual field, which was significantly more than 3 (1, 10) in PCL+polyurethane group and 9 (2, 13) in polyurethane alone group (with Z values of 2.61 and 2.40, respectively, P<0.05). Conclusions: The prepared PCL negative pressure material and PBS negativepressure material have good biocompatibility, and can successfully construct the new matrix of full-thickness skin defect wounds in rats. PCL negative pressurematerial is better than PBS negative pressure material in general.

AB  - The screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was one step modified with graphene(GN) and UiO-66 composites in nafion solution as a portable sensor(nafion/UiO-66/GN/SPCE) for the detection of synephrine. The used GN and UiO-66were well-characterized, exhibiting typical structures by scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray powderdiffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thenafion/UiO-66/GN/SPCE showed the maximum electrochemical signals for synephrinewhen comparing fabricated components in the cyclic voltammetric method. It wassystematically investigated in modifier composition, modification volumes, pH,scan rate, and quantitative analysis ability. Under optimal conditions, thesensor exhibited a good detection limit (0.04 mumol L(-1)) for synephrine with a linear range of 0.5 mumol L(-1) to 60 mumol L(-1) (r(2) = 0.995). Thenafion/UiO-66/GN/SPCE had adequate reproducibility and stability with relativestandard deviations lower than 2.01%. It was also applied to determine synephrinein the extract of Citrus aurantium L. with recoveries between 99.0% and 102.0%.The content of synephrine was in good agreement with that of the HPLC method.Based on its convenience and stability, the proposed nafion/UiO-66/GN/SPCE could be further developed as a portable and rapid detection sensor for natural active compounds in food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical fields.

AB  - Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) offers insight into the band structureof quantum materials from the Fourier transform of local density of states (LDOS)maps. Their acquisition with a scanning tunneling microscope is traditionallytedious due to the large number of required measurements that may take severaldays to complete. The recent demonstration of sparse sampling for QPI imagingshowed how the effective measurement time could be fundamentally reduced by only sampling a small and random subset of the total LDOS. However, the amount ofrequired sub-sampling to faithfully recover the QPI image remained a recurringquestion. Here we introduce an adaptive sparse sampling (ASS) approach in whichwe gradually accumulate sparsely sampled LDOS measurements until a desiredquality level is achieved via compressive sensing recovery. The iterativelymeasured random subset of the LDOS can be interleaved with regular topographicimages that are used for image registry and drift correction. These referencetopographies also allow to resume interrupted measurements to further improve theQPI quality. Our ASS approach is a convenient extension to quasiparticleinterference imaging that should remove further hesitation in the implementation of sparse sampling mapping schemes. * Accumulative sampling for unknown degree ofsparsity * Controllably interrupt and resume QPI measurements * Scattering waveconserving background subtractions.

AB  - Erosive beverages cause dissolution of natural teeth and intra-oral restorations,resulting in surface characteristic changes, particularly roughness anddegradation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surface roughness and topography of a dental ceramic following immersion in locally available erosivesolutions. A total of 160 disc specimens of a nano-fluorapatite type ceramic (12 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness) were fabricated and equally distributed into two groups (n = 80) and then evenly distributed among the following five testinggroups (n = 16): lemon juice, citrate buffer solution, 4% acetic acid, soft cola drink, and distilled water which served as a control. The surface roughness (Ra) and topography were evaluated using a profilometer and scanning electronmicroscope at baseline, 24 h, 96 h, and 168 h respectively. Data were analyzedusing ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons (p </= 0.05). Surface changes wereobserved upon exposure to all acidic beverages except distilled water. Amongstall immersion media, 4% acetic acid produced the most severe surface roughnessacross all time periods (i.e., baseline, 24 h, 96 h, and 168 h). A statistically significant difference in the surface roughness values between all immersionmedia and across all four time intervals was observed. Erosive agents had anegative effect on the surface roughness and topography of the tested ceramic.The surface roughness increased with increased storage time intervals.

TI  - Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Loaded with a Boron-Based Hybrid as a Promising Drug Carrier System for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23158249 [doi]
AB  - The search for an innovative and effective drug delivery system that can carryand release targeted drugs with enhanced activity to treat Alzheimer's diseasehas received much attention in the last decade. In this study, we first designed a boron-based drug delivery system for effective treatment of AD by integratingthe folic acid (FA) functional group into hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)nanoparticles (NPs) through an esterification reaction. The hBN-FA drug carriersystem was assembled with a new drug candidate and a novel boron-based hybridcontaining an antioxidant as BLA, to constitute a self-assembled AD nanotransport system. We performed molecular characterization analyses by usingUV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR),scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)and Zeta potential investigations. Second, we tested the anti-Alzheimerproperties of the carrier system on a differentiated neuroblastoma (SHSY5-Y) cellline, which was exposed to beta-amyloid (1-42) peptides to stimulate anexperimental in vitro AD model. Next, we performed cytotoxicity analyses ofsynthesized molecules on the human dermal fibroblast cell line (HDFa) and theexperimental AD model. Cytotoxicity analyses showed that even higherconcentrations of the carrier system did not enhance the toxicological outcome inHDFa cells. Drug loading analyses reported that uncoated hBN nano conjugate couldnot load the BLA, whereas the memantine loading capacity of hBN was 84.3%. On theother hand, memantine and the BLA loading capacity of the hBN-FA construct wasfound to be 95% and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, we investigated theneuroprotective properties of the nano carrier systems in the experimental ADmodel. According to the results, 25 microg/mL concentrations of hBN-FA+memantine (94% cell viability) and hBN-FA+BLA (99% cell viability) showed ameliorativeproperties against beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide toxicity (50% cell viability).These results were generated through the use of flow cytometry,acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and antioxidant assays. In conclusion, the developed drug carrier system for AD treatment showed promising potential for furtherinvestigations and enlightened neuroprotective capabilities of boron molecules totreat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, enzymeactivity, systematic toxicity analyses, and animal studies should be performed tounderstand neuroprotective properties of the designed carrier systemcomprehensively.

AB  - The status and stability of the unreacted silica fume (SF) agglomerates existing in concrete structures subjected to various deterioration environments is largelyunknown, but is a critical issue which could cause public concern. This workemployed a Raman microscope, which combines the Raman spectroscopy with a lightoptical microscope, to characterize the phase assemblage in 6-month-old SFblended Portland cement (PC) pastes after 3-month exposure to simulateddeterioration mechanisms (viz. carbonation, chloride attack, or sulfate attack), in order to illustrate the status of SF. Unhydrated SF phases, in terms ofamorphous silica (Raman shift at about 350-540 cm(-1)), were identified in the SFblended paste samples after being exposed to carbonation and sulfate attack,indicating that there is a potential hazard to the living system, especially the structures undergoing long-term 'interactions' with a contiguous environment.

LID - 10.3390/ma15155159 [doi]
AB  - The feasibility of producing welding joints between 6061-T6 aluminum and purecopper sheets of 6 mm thickness by conventional friction stir welding (CFSW) and bobbin tool friction stir welding (BTFSW) by using a slot-groove configuration atthe joining surface was investigated. The microstructure of the welded sampleswas examined by using an optical microscope and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore,the mechanical properties of the weld samples are compared based on the resultsof the tensile test, hardness measurement, and fractography test. The slot-grooveconfiguration resulted in the presence of a bulk-sized Al block on the Cu side.The microscopic observations revealed the dispersion of fine Cu particles in the stir zone. The presence of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) CuAl2, which are hardand brittle, lowered the strength of the weld joints. The strength of the weldjoints produced with BTFSW was superior to that of the C-FSW. The maximumhardness values of 214 HV and 211 HV are reported at the stir zone for BTFSW and CFSW, respectively. The fracture location of all the joints was at theintersection of the stir zone and the thermomechanically affected zone was on theCu side.

AB  - Mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) are a kind of engineering and functional artificialcarbon materials generally prepared by the polymerization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The physicochemical property of the raw materials plays a key role in the quality of MCMBs. For a detailed analysis of the synergistic effects ofthe generation of MCMBs, a high-temperature coal tar pitch was used as rawmaterials, and coal pyrolytic extracts were used as additive to synthesize theMCMBs. The microstructure and morphology of the derived MCMBs were determined by an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Ramanspectrum, and laser particle size analyzer. In fact, the addition of the coalpyrolytic extracts can adjust the molecular structure of the blending pitch, and the coal pyrolytic extracts can promote the generation of the MCMBs during theco-polycondensation process. The MCMBs obtained by co-polycondensation methodhave a good degree of sphericity, lower defects in the surface morphology, and a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 4.677 Omega.

TI  - Hypoxic lung cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-21 mediates macrophage M2polarization and promotes cancer cell proliferation through targeting IRF1.
PG  - 241
LID - 10.1186/s12957-022-02706-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is the hallmark of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and playsa critical role during the progress of tumor development. A variety of microRNAs (miRNAs) transmitted by tumor-derived exosomes were involved in intercellularcommunication. We aimed to elucidate the precise mechanism by which tumorcell-derived exosomes promote lung cancer development by affecting macrophagepolarization under hypoxic conditions. METHODS: CD163 signal in tumor tissue fromlung cancer patients was detected by immunohistochemical (IHC). The M2polarization-related markers were assessed by flow cytometry and western blot.Exosomes were isolated from normoxic and hypoxic lung cancer cell culture andcharacterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering(DLS), and western blot. RNA sequencing was performed to show the abnormallyexpressed miRNAs in exosomes from normoxic and hypoxic lung cancer cell culture. In addition, CCK-8 and clone formation assays were used to assess cellproliferation. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate therelationship between miR-21 and IRF1. For in vivo experiment, the male nude mice were injected with H1299 cells with exosomes and miR-21 mimic treatment. RESULTS:Firstly, we found a strong CD163 signal in tumor tissue from lung cancer patientsby IHC. Subsequently, we co-cultured lung cancer cell line H1299 with M0macrophage THP-1 and found that H1299 in a hypoxic environment promoted THP-1 M2 polarization. PKH67 fluorescence staining experiments confirmed that exosomes of H1299 origin were able to enter THP-1 and induced M2 polarization. RNA sequencingof exosomes showed that miR-21 level was significantly higher in the hypoxicculture group compared to the normoxic group. Subsequent cellular assays showedthat miR-21 inhibited the expression of IRF1 by targeting it. In addition, theoverexpression of IRF1 reversed the role of miR-21 on macrophage M2 polarization.Finally, we have confirmed through animal experiments that either hypoxicenvironment or high miR-21 level promoted tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: HighmiR-21 level in hypoxic environments promoted macrophage M2 polarization andinduced lung cancer progression through targeting IRF1.

TI  - Single-crystal structure determination of nanosized metal-organic frameworks bythree-dimensional electron diffraction.
LID - 10.1038/s41596-022-00720-8 [doi]
AB  - Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable interest due to theirwell-defined pore architecture and structural tunability on molecular dimensions.While single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) has been widely used to elucidate the structures of MOFs at the atomic scale, the formation of large andwell-ordered crystals is still a crucial bottleneck for structure determination. To alleviate this challenge, three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) hasbeen developed for structure determination of nano- (submicron-)sized crystals.Such 3D ED data are collected from each single crystal using transmissionelectron microscopy. In this protocol, we introduce the entire workflow forstructural analysis of MOFs by 3D ED, from sample preparation, data acquisitionand data processing to structure determination. We describe methods for crystalscreening and handling of crystal agglomerates, which are crucial steps in samplepreparation for single-crystal 3D ED data collection. We further present how toset up a transmission electron microscope for 3D ED data acquisition and, moreimportantly, offer suggestions for the optimization of data acquisitionconditions. For data processing, including unit cell and space groupdetermination, and intensity integration, we provide guidelines on how to useelectron and X-ray crystallography software to process 3D ED data. Finally, wepresent structure determination from 3D ED data and discuss the importantfeatures associated with 3D ED data that need to be considered. We believe thatthis protocol provides critical details for implementing and utilizing 3D ED as astructure determination platform for nano- (submicron-)sized MOFs as well asother crystalline materials.

TI  - Clinical comparison of manual and laser-cut corneal tunnel for intrastromal airinjection in femtosecond laser-assisted deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty(DALK).
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05765-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most crucial step in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) isto achieve a bare Descemet's membrane. We aimed to assess a new femtosecond lasersoftware that allows for a precise intrastromal tunnel creation for big bubble(BB) air injection using a real-time microscope-integrated optical coherencetomography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 61 eyes of 61patients with keratoconus. Before introducing the new software update, DALK wasperformed using a partial-assisted femtosecond laser (partial-thickness circular cut followed by a lamellar cut) with manual intrastromal tunnel creation (partialFS-DALK group). After the software update, the femtosecond laser created theintrastromal tunnel (full FS-DALK group). RESULTS: In the full FS-DALK group, theBB's formation was significantly higher (64.3% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.04), and surgery time was shorter (21.8 +/- 5.1 vs. 25.6 +/- 6.8 min, p = 0.025) than in thepartial FS-DALK. Penetrating keratoplasty conversion rate (7.1% vs. 15.1%, p =0.432) was similar between the groups. Both groups showed statisticallysignificant improvement in uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity,central corneal thickness, surface asymmetry, and regularity indices. Endothelialcell density loss at 12 and 18 months was lower in the full compared with thepartial FS-DALK group (12 months:10.0% vs. 16; 18 months: 10.7 vs. 16.5%, p <0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Creating the intrastromal guidingtunnel using FS laser for air injection resulted in a higher rate of BBformation, reduced long-term endothelial cell loss, and operating room time.

TI  - Tracking single adatoms in liquid in a Transmission Electron Microscope.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05130-0 [doi]
AB  - Single atoms or ions on surfaces affect processes from nucleation(1) toelectrochemical reactions(2) and heterogeneous catalysis(3). Transmissionelectron microscopy (TEM) is a leading approach for visualizing single atoms on avariety of substrates(4,5.) It conventionally requires high vacuum conditions,but has been developed for in situ imaging in liquid and gaseousenvironments(6,7) with a combined spatial and temporal resolution that isunmatched by any other method -notwithstanding concerns about electron beameffects on samples. When imaging in liquid using commercial technologies,electron scattering in the windows enclosing the sample and in the liquidgenerally limits the achievable resolution to a few nanometres(6,8,9). Grapheneliquid cells, on the other hand, have enabled atomic resolution imaging of metal nanoparticles in liquids(10). Here we show that a double graphene liquid cell,comprised of a central molybdenum disulphide monolayer separated by hexagonalboron nitride spacers from the two enclosing graphene windows, makes it possible to monitor with atomic resolution the dynamics of platinum adatoms on themonolayer in an aqueous salt solution. By imaging over 70,000 single adatomadsorption sites, we compare the site preference and dynamic motion of theadatoms in both a fully hydrated and vacuum state. We find a modified adsorption site distribution and higher diffusivities for the adatoms in liquid phasecompared to those in vacuum. This approach paves the way for in situ liquid phaseimaging of chemical processes with single atom precision.

TI  - Biocompatibility of the Oxygenator on Pulsatile Flow by Electron Microscope.
LID - 10.21470/1678-9741-2021-0519 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal perfusion flow type requires further investigation. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of pulsatile and nonpulsatileflow on oxygenator fibers that were analyzed by scanning electron microscope(SEM) and to extensively study patients' coagulation profiles, inflammatorymarkers, and functional blood tests. METHODS: Twelve patients who had open heart surgery were randomly divided into two groups; the nonpulsatile flow (group NP,six patients) and pulsatile flow (group P, six patients) groups. Both superficialview and axial sections of the oxygenator fiber samples were examined under SEMto compare the thickness of absorbed blood proteins and amount of blood cells on the surface of oxygenators. Platelet count, coagulation profile, and inflammatorypredictors were also studied from the blood samples. RESULTS: Fibrinogen levelsafter cardiopulmonary bypass were significantly lower in group NP (group P,2.57+/-2.78 g/L; group NP; 2.39+/-0.70 g/L, P=0.03). Inflammatory biomarkers suchas C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, apelin, S100beta, and tumornecrosis factor alpha were comparable in both groups. Axial sections of theoxygenator fiber samples had a mean thickness of 45.2 microm and 46.5 microm ingroups P and NP, respectively, and this difference is statistically significant(P=0.006). Superficial view of the fiber samples showed obviously lower platelet,leukocyte, and erythrocyte levels in group P. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that both cellular elements and protein adsorption on oxygenator fibers are lowerin the group P than in the group NP. Pulsatile perfusion has betterbiocompatibility on extracorporeal circulation when analyzed by SEM technique.

TI  - Entrapment and Delivery of Doxorubicin: Employing a Permeable Lipopeptide-BasedHydrogel as an Efficient Cationic Binder.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04068-3 [doi]
AB  - Lipopeptides have been the subject of great interest as vehicles for drugdelivery, but the potential usage of their biological composites has not beenextensively studied. Here, the extracellular lipopeptide composite (ELC) of alipopeptide-producing bacterium was extracted and examined to deliver doxorubicin(DOX) as a cationic drug. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis on the lipopeptidemoiety of ELC revealed that this hydrogel consists of 13 lipopeptide isomers.Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies showed that thepermeability of ELC in acidic pH was significantly more than basic condition. In this study, 81% of DOX was successfully entrapped in ELC and the release of thedrug was measured in acidic, neutral, and basic conditions. The results indicatedthat the release profile of the drug in acidic pH was about 10 and 16 fold morethan neutral and basic conditions, respectively. Besides, the toxicity ofDOX-conjugated ELC against PBMC cells was more than free DOX, suggesting theadequate drug release from ELC. Since the surrounding environment of tumor cells is often acidic, this pH-sensitive carrier could be a candidate for cancertherapy to improve the exposure of tumor cells to the drugs.

TI  - Macrophage-Targeting and Complete Lysosomal Degradation of Self-assembledTwo-Dimensional Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) Platelet Particles.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c06555 [doi]
AB  - Understanding cellular uptake and particle trafficking within the cells isessential for targeted drug delivery applications. Existing studies reveal thatthe geometrical aspects of nanocarriers, for example, shape and size, determinetheir cell uptake and sub-cellular transport pathways. However, considerableefforts have been directed toward understanding the cell uptake mechanism andtrafficking of spherical particles. Detailed analysis on the uptake mechanism anddownstream intracellular processing of non-spherical particles remains elusive.Here, we used polymeric two-dimensional platelets based onpoly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) prepared by living crystallization-drivenself-assembly as a platform to investigate the cell uptake and intracellulartransport of non-spherical particles in vitro. PCL is known to degrade onlyslowly, and these platelets were still stable after 2 days of incubation inartificial lysosomal media. Upon cell uptake, the platelets were transportedthrough an endo/lysosomal pathway and were found to degrade completely in thelysosome at the end of the cell uptake cycle. We observed a morphologicaltransformation of the lysosomes, which correlates with the stages of plateletdegradation in the lysosome. Overall, we found an accelerated degradation of PCL,which was likely caused by mechanical forces inside the highly stretchedendosomes.

TI  - Melatonin Attenuates the Progression of Osteoarthritis in Rats by InhibitingInflammation and Related Oxidative Stress on the Surface of Knee Cartilage.
LID - 10.1111/os.13408 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between melatonin and osteoarthritis(OA) in rats. To explore the relevant mechanisms in the occurrence anddevelopment of osteoarthritis in rats, and to further understand the disease ofosteoarthritis. METHODS: Forty healthy 6-month-old male SD rats were randomlydivided into two groups: sham and drug intervention groups. Pre-OA modeling,enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to detect the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, COX-2, and melatonin in the serum of the rats in each group. For OAmodeling, we administered an injection of papain into the knee cavity of allrats. The levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and COX-2 in the serum of rats in each group were detected 2 weeks after the modeling. Additionally, 2 weeks after themodeling, the rats in the drug intervention group were intraperitoneally injectedwith melatonin antagonists. The rats in the sham group were intraperitoneallyinjected with normal saline for 2 weeks. The levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and COX-2 in the serum of each group were measured at the second, third, and fourth weeksafter the drug intervention, and the levels of melatonin in the serum weremeasured at the second week after the drug intervention. Finally, the rats wereeuthanized by cervical dislocation, and pathological sections were collected fromthe knee joint to observe the pathological tissue changes under a microscope, andMankin score was determined. The independent samples t-test method was used foranalysis. RESULTS: The imaging examination after the drug intervention showedthat the modeling of knee osteoarthritis in rats was successful. In thepathological findings, HE staining showed a legible cartilage structure of eachlayer, with cartilage proliferation and partial cartilage tearing to the radiallayer. The tide line was intact; toluidine blue staining revealed more obviouschanges. The differences among the mean values of IL-6, IL-1beta, and COX-2measured in each period were statistically significant (t = 5.50, p < 0.05). The measured mean values of IL-6, IL-1beta, and COX-2 revealed statisticallysignificant differences among the groups (t = 2.01, p < 0.05). The intergroupcomparison of the Mankin scores in each period showed statistically significantdifferences. CONCLUSION: Melatonin may inhibit inflammation and associatedoxidative stress on the surface of knee cartilage. It may be related to therepair and regeneration of articular surface cartilage during the development of OA in the rat knee joint.

TI  - Reducing VEGFB expression regulates the balance of glucose and lipid metabolismin mice via VEGFR1.
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2022.12801 [doi]
LID - 285 [pii]
AB  - In recent years, studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growthfactor B (VEGFB) can affect the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose, and it is expected to become a target for the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseasessuch as obesity and diabetes. At present, the specific mechanism that VEGFBregulates lipid and glucose metabolism balance is not completely understood. The present study used systemic VEGFB geneknockout mice to investigate the effects ofdownregulation of the VEGFB gene on lipid metabolism and insulin secretion, andto explore the mechanism of the VEGFB pathway involved in the regulation ofglucose and lipid metabolism. The morphological changes in the liver and pancreasof mice after VEGFB gene deletion were observed under a light microscope and ascanning electron microscope, and the effects of VEGFB gene deletion on lipidmetabolism and blood glucose balance were detected by a serological technique.The detection indexes included total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG),lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and highdensity lipoproteincholesterol. Simultaneously, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c), fasting insulin and glucagon were measured. Insulin sensitivity wasassessed by using the insulin tolerance tests and glucose tolerance tests, andfunction of betacell islets was evaluated by using the insulin resistance index(HOMAIR) and pancreatic betacell secretion index (HOMAbeta). Tauhe proteinexpression changes of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in mouse islets weredetected by western blotting and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerasechain reaction (RTqPCR) after the VEGFB gene was knocked down to analyze themechanism of VEGFB that may be involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. It wasobserved that after VEGFB was knocked down, mouse hepatocytes exhibited steatosisand increased secretory vesicles in islet cells. The lipid metabolism indexessuch as TG, TC and LDL increased significantly; however, the levels of FBS,postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c decreased, whereas the glucose toleranceincreased. Serum insulin secretion increased and HOMAIR decreased since VEGFB wasknocked down. Western blotting and RTqPCR results revealed that the expressionlevels of VEGFR1 and neuropilin1 decreased after the VEGFB gene was knocked down,while the expression levels of VEGFA and VEGFR2 increased. The absence of VEGFBmay be involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in mice byactivating the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFB is expected to become a new target for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Atpresent, the mechanism of VEGFB involved in regulating lipid metabolism andglucose metabolism is not completely clear. It was identified that downregulatingVEGFB improved lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. The role of VEGFB/VEGFR1 pathway and other family members in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism wasdetected, which provided a theoretical and experimental basis for VEGFB to affectthe regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism balance.

AB  - It is critical to understand the starch-protein interactions in food systems toobtain products with desired functional properties. This study aimed toinvestigate the influence of mung bean protein isolate (MBPI) on the rheological,textural, and structural properties of native corn starch (NCS) and theirpossible interactions during gelatinization. The dynamic rheological measurementsshowed a decrease in the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") and anincrease in the loss factor (tan delta), by adding MBPI to NCS gels. In addition,the textural properties represented a reduction in firmness after the addition ofMBPI. The Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the freeze-dried NCS/MBPI gels confirmed that the NCS gel became softer by incorporating the MBPI.Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed a peak at 17.4 degrees , andthe relative crystallinity decreased with increasing MBPI concentrations. Theturbidity determination after 120 h refrigerated storage showed that the additionof MBPI could reduce the retrogradation of NCS gels by interacting with leachedamylose. Additionally, the syneresis of NCS/MBPI gels decreased at 14 days ofrefrigerated storage from 60.53 to 47.87%.

LID - 10.3390/polym14153006 [doi]
AB  - This study employed response surface methodology to optimize the preparation ofbiocomposites based on whey protein isolate, glycerol, and nanocrystallinecellulose from pineapple crown leaf. The effects of different concentrations ofnanocrystalline cellulose as a filler and glycerol as a plasticizer on thethickness, the tensile strength, and the elongation at break on the resultingbiocomposite films were investigated. The central composite design was used todetermine the optimum preparation conditions for biocomposite films with optimum properties. The regression of a second-order polynomial model resulted in anoptimum composition consisting of 4% glycerol and 3.5% nanocrystalline cellulose concentrations, which showed a desirability of 92.7%. The prediction of theregression model was validated by characterizing the biocomposite film preparedbased on the optimum composition, at which the thickness, tensile strength, andelongation at break of the biocomposite film were 0.13 mm, 7.16 MPa, and 39.10%, respectively. This optimum composition can be obtained in range concentrations ofglycerol (4-8%) and nanocrystalline cellulose (3-7%). Scanning electronmicroscope images showed that nanocrystalline cellulose dispersed well in thepure whey protein isolate, and the films had a relatively smooth surface. Incomparison, a rough and uneven surface results in more porous biocomposite films.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that nanocrystalline celluloseand glycerol showed good compatibility with WPI film by forming hydrogen bonds.The addition of nanocrystalline cellulose as a filler also decreased thetransparency, solubility, and water vapor permeability and increased thecrystallinity index of the resulting biocomposite film.

TI  - Study on the Impact and Water Absorption Performance of Prosopis juliflora &Glass Fibre Reinforced Epoxy Composite Laminates.
LID - 2973 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14152973 [doi]
AB  - Current global trends demand the replacement of synthetic fibres with naturalfibres in polymeric composites. The present work makes use of Prosopis juliflora,a plant that is a threat to the environment as a partial replacement in a hybrid composite. Individual Prosopis juliflora fibres are added to matrices at ratiosof 12, 6, 9 and 8 wt % and glass fibres are added discretely at ratios of 28, 24,21 and 32 wt % into matrices as well. The composites are prepared with fourdifferent combinations and tested in terms of the mechanical benefits and waterabsorption performance. This work exploits the mechanical advantage of impactenergy in addition to producing Prosopis juliflora particles, fibre glass mats,and resin appropriate for structural uses. Water absorption tests are conductedfor four different compositions. Among the four samples, sample 3 (9 wt %Prosopis juliflora fibres and 21 wt % glass fibres) has a higher rate of waterabsorption than the others, although sample 2 (6 wt % Prosopis juliflora fibresand 24 wt % glass fibres) has a lower rate. The difference in the quantity ofwater absorption between the hybrid composites can be attributed to the weightpercentage of fibres. On the other hand, sample 1 (12 wt % Prosopis juliflorafibres and 28 wt % glass fibres) is reported to have absorbed 2.6 J of energy in the impact strength test. The increase in impact strength is attributed to theincrease in the weight percentage of glass fibres. A scanning electron microscopeis employed to study the fractured surfaces of the composites. This study showsthat the developed hybrid composite could be employed in structural andautomotive applications because of its improved impact strength and waterresistance.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081551 [doi]
AB  - Biocompatible and biodegradable materials have been used for fabricatingpolymeric microneedles to deliver therapeutic drug molecules through the skin.Microneedles have advantages over other drug delivery methods, such as lowmanufacturing cost, controlled drug release, and the reduction or absence ofpain. The study examined the delivery of amphotericin B, an antifungal agent,using microneedles that were fabricated using a micromolding technique. Themicroneedle matrix was made from Gantrez(TM) AN-119 BF, a benzene-free methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer. The Gantrez(TM) AN-119 BF was mixed with water; after water evaporation, the polymer exhibited sufficient strength formicroneedle fabrication. Molds cured at room temperature remained sharp andstraight. SEM images showed straight and sharp needle tips; a confocal microscopewas used to determine the height and tip diameter for the microneedles.Nanoindentation was used to obtain the hardness and Young's modulus values of thepolymer. Load-displacement testing was used to assess the failure force of theneedles under compressive loading. These two mechanical tests confirmed themechanical properties of the needles. In vitro studies validated the presence of amphotericin B in the needles and the antifungal properties of the needles.Amphotericin B Gantrez(TM) microneedles fabricated in this study showedappropriate characteristics for clinical translation in terms of mechanicalproperties, sharpness, and antifungal properties.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081549 [doi]
AB  - Significant improvements in the wettability and dissolution rate of celecoxib(CEL), a poorly soluble selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, have beenshown by Huyn et al., 2019 by combining the binary pharmaceutical compositionsincluding CEL and one of the two co-formers, adipic acid (ADI) and saccharin(SAC), into eutectic mixtures (EM). Purpose: In this study, we developed atherapeutic eutectic system for CEL which is a promising approach for oraldelivery to enhance bioavailability. CEL EM were synthesized by novel techniques including supercritical CO2 techniques and new tablet formulations were purposed.Methods: CEL EM were synthesized by evaporation crystallization method, spraydrying, supercritical fluid (SCF) techniques. The CEL EM particles were thencharacterized by differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, andparticle size analysis. Dissolution studies were carried out. With a quality bydesign approach, a statistical method through design of experiment and dataanalysis by JMP((R)) (SAS institute) was applied to CEL EM immediate releasetablet formulation development. Results: CEL EM produced by spray dryingtechnique, supercritical fluid (SCF) techniques were identified andcharacterized. The enhancement of dissolution was observed for SCF processedsamples. The design space for CEL-ADI EM IR tablet and control limits forindividual parameters were determined.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081547 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on improving curcumin stability in various pHs and NaClconcentrations and reducing the strong scent of turmeric by the nanoemulsionssystem and further coating with water-soluble chitosan (WSC). Turmericextract-loaded nanoemulsions (TE-NEs) were firstly prepared by mixing an oilphase containing turmeric extract, MCT oil, and lecithin, and an aqueous phasecontaining tween 80 using an ultrasonication method. TE-NEs were further coatedwith WSC in the ratio of TE-NEs and WSC (1:1 to 1:10). The optimum WSC-TE-NEsexhibited an average particle size of 182 nm, a PDI of 0.317, and a zetapotential of +30.42 mV when WSC-TE-NEs were prepared in the ratio of 1:1. Thestability of the WSC-TE-NEs was also assessed by determining the remainedcurcumin content. The remained curcumin contents of the TE-NEs and the WSC-TE-NEswere higher than that of the turmeric extract (TE) at pH 2~7 and NaClconcentrations of 100~400 mM. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra,transmission electron microscope (TEM), and confocal laser scanning microscope(CLSM) images confirmed that the TE-NEs were successfully encapsulated with a WSCcoating. As a result of GC analysis, the content of aromatic-turmerone wassignificantly decreased in the TE-NEs and the WSC-TE-NEs compared to the pristineTE, but there was no significant difference between the TE-NEs and theWSC-TE-NEs. These results suggest that water-soluble chitosan-coatednanoemulsions may be suitable for improving the chemical stability and maskingeffect of curcumin to facilitate its application in food.

AB  - TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were modified to obtain photocatalysts with differentcomposition sophistication and displaying improved visible light activity. All ofthem were evaluated in the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin. The band gap ofTiO2 NPs was successfully tailored by the formation of an N-doped porous carbon(NPC)-TiO2 nanohybrid through the pyrolysis of melamine at 600 degrees C, leadingto a slight red-shift of the absorption band edge for nanohybridNPC-TiO2&amp;nbsp;1. In addition, the in-situ formation and grafting of plasmonicAuAg NPs at the surface of NPC sheets and in close contact with TiO2 NPs leads toAuAg-NPC-TiO2 nanohybrids 2-3. These nanohybrids showed superior photocatalyticperformance for the degradation of ciprofloxacin under visible light irradiation,compared to pristine P25 TiO2 NPs or to AuAg-PVP-TiO2 nanohybrid 4 in whichpolyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized AuAg NPs were directly grafted to TiO2 NPs. Thematerials were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), HighAngle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-EnergyDispersive X-ray Spectroscopy HAADF-STEM-EDS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopyand solid UV-vis spectroscopy. Moreover, the active species involved in thephotodegradation of ciprofloxacin using AuAg-NCS-TiO2 nanohybrids were evaluated by trapping experiments to propose a mechanism for the degradation.

TI  - Ferroelectricity and Piezoelectricity in 2D Van der Waals CuInP2S6 Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions.
LID - 2516 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12152516 [doi]
AB  - CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectriclayered material with a Curie temperature of TC~315 K, making it promising forgreat potential applications in electronic and photoelectric devices. Herein, theferroelectric and electric properties of CIPS at different thicknesses arecarefully evaluated by scanning probe microscopy techniques. Some defects in somelocal regions due to Cu deficiency lead to a CuInP2S6-In4/3P2S6 (CIPS-IPS)paraelectric phase coexisting with the CIPS ferroelectric phase. Anelectrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) study reveals that the relaxation timescorresponding to the Cu ions and the IPS ionospheres are not the same, with asignificant difference in their response to DC voltage, related to therectification effect of the ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ). The electricproperties of the FTJ indicate Cu(+) ion migration and propose that the currentflow and device performance are dynamically controlled by an interfacial Schottkybarrier. The addition of the ferroelectricity of CIPS opens up applications inmemories and sensors, actuators, and even spin-orbit devices based on 2D vdWheterostructures.

AB  - Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has become an alternative material for orthopaedicsand dental implants. However, bio-inertness is an important limitation in thismaterial. In the present study, a hydroxyapatite (HA)-titanium nitride (TiN)coating was fabricated via pulsed DC magnetron sputtering and treated withhydrothermal treatment to improve the bioactive property of PEEK. The dissolutionbehavior of the coating was studied in simulated body fluid solution (SBF) at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days. The coating surface was analyzed before andafter the immersion process by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomicforce microscope (AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The calcium andphosphorus concentration alteration in SBF was quantified by an inductivelycoupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Coating dissolution andthe precipitation of calcium phosphate complex from SBF were observed asoccurring suddenly and continuously throughout the immersion times. Theseprocesses resulted in an alteration in both physical and chemical coatingproperties. After 56 days, the coating remained on PEEK surfaces and the Ca/Pratio was 1.16. These results indicate that HA-TiN coating via pulsed DCmagnetron sputtering followed by hydrothermal treatment improved the bioactivity of materials and provided a potential benefit to orthopedics and dentalapplications.

AB  - In the present study we evaluated the cytotoxicity of super-oxidized water onhuman gingival fibroblasts and its efficacy in debris and smear layer removalfrom root canal walls. Cultured gingival fibroblasts were exposed tosuper-oxidized water (Sterilox), which was diluted in Iscove's modifiedDulbecco's medium (IMDM) at 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% concentrations. Thecontrol group was maintained in IMDM. The cell viability was evaluated by meansof an MTT assay after incubation periods of 1 h, 2 h, 24 h and 48 h. Pathologicalcellular changes were also observed under fluorescence and phase contrastmicroscopes. The efficacy in debris and smear layer removal was evaluated incomparison to the conventional application of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) andethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Forty maxillary premolars were randomlydivided into two equal groups (n = 20) and shaped with ProTaper NEXT rotaryinstruments using Sterilox or NaOCl/EDTA for irrigation. Afterwards, roots weresplit longitudinally and examined under a scanning electron microscope. Theresults revealed that super-oxidized water and sterile distilled water haveacceptable biological properties for endodontic applications at concentrations upto 50% (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, super-oxidized water is equally effective indebris and smear layer removal as compared to NaOCl/EDTA (p &gt; 0.05).

TI  - Healing Abutment Distortion in Implant Prostheses: An In Vitro Study.
LID - 85 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jfb13030085 [doi]
AB  - Little has been studied regarding the repeated usage of healing abutments andtheir effects on the distortion of dental implant-healing abutment hex surfaces. Additionally, implant manufacturers do not provide specific guidelines on howmany times a healing abutment can be used before discarding. Therefore, weevaluated the effect of repeated screwing-unscrewing of implant-healing abutment on the healing abutment hex surface and screw head. A total of 12 Biomateimplants with 4 mm diameter and 13 mm length were inserted into a synthetic bone block. The standard healing abutments of 3 mm diameter and 4 mm length werescrewed onto each implant using a torque ratchet at a final torque of 30 Ncm.Immediately, the abutments were unscrewed at 30 Ncm. Then, screwing-unscrewingwas repeated for 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 400 times and thehealing abutments were scanned under the scanning electron microscope for anydistortion. Distortion was graded as 0, 1, 2, and 3. Data were analyzed usingSPSS 24.0. Descriptive statistics were calculated. One-way ANOVA with post hocusing Tukey's HSD test was performed to analyze the difference in distortion atdifferent screwing-unscrewing times. A significant level was selected at p-value = 0.05. It was found that distortion healing abutments screws were seen after 32 times screwing and unscrewing. There was a significant difference in thedistortion (p-value &lt; 0.05) after 24 times of repeated usage of healingabutment and at 160, 320, and 400 times. No surface distortions were observed at the healing abutment screw head at 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 400cycles of screwing-unscrewing. It can be concluded that repeated screwing andunscrewing of the implant-healing abutments causes damage to the healing abutmenthex surface. The distortion of healing abutments screws was seen after 32 timesscrewing and unscrewing. No surface distortions were observed on the healingabutment screw head until 400 times of screwing and unscrewing. Hence, theclinician should be cautious while using the healing abutments repeatedly.

TI  - 3D Visualization System in Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK): ASix-Month Comparison with Conventional Microscope.
LID - 4312 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of Descemet membrane endothelialkeratoplasty (DMEK) surgery using the three-dimensional (3D) display systemNGENUITY to DMEK surgery performed with the traditional microscope (TM) inpatients affected by Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Disease (FECD). METHODS:Retrospective comparative study of 40 pseudophakic eyes of 40 patients affectedby FECD who underwent DMEK surgery. Twenty patients (3D group) were operated onusing the 3D display system and 20 patients (TM group) were operated on using thetraditional microscope. Best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), centralcorneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell density (ECD) and corneal densitometry (CD) values were documented before and at 1, 3 and 6 months after DMEK. Intra-and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS: The baseline assessments did not differ between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Global surgical time andtime to perform descemetorhexis were significantly lower in the TM group (p =0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively). BSCVA, CCT, ECD and CD values did not differsignificantly in the two groups at all follow-ups (p &gt; 0.05). Complicationrate was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional displaysystems can be securely employed in DMEK surgery considering the satisfactoryclinical outcomes, including Scheimpflug CD. Nevertheless, the slightly longersurgical time of the 3D DMEKs may lead to surgeons' hesitancy. The mainadvantages of the heads-up approach may be the improved ergonomic comfort during surgery and the utility of assistants in surgical training.

LID - 10.3390/foods11152230 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a widespread foodborne pathogen that causes seriousseafood-borne gastrointestinal infections. Biofilm and quorum sensing (QS) arecritical in regulating these infections. In this study, first, the ability ofLactiplantibacillus plantarum Z057 to compete, exclude, and displace V.parahaemolyticus biofilm was evaluated. Then, the inhibitory effects of L.plantarum Z057 extract (Z057-E) on V. parahaemolyticus biofilm and QS wereexplored from the aspects of biofilm biomass, metabolic activity, physicochemicalproperties, extracellular polymer matrix content, QS signal AI-2 activity,biofilm microstructure, and the expression levels of biofilm and QS-relatedgenes. Results showed that L. plantarum Z057 effectively inhibited biofilmformation of V. parahaemolyticus and interfered with the adhesion of V.parahaemolyticus on the carrier surface. In addition, the Z057-E couldsignificantly reduce the biofilm biomass, metabolic activity, hydrophobicity,auto-aggregation ability, swimming and swarming migration diameter, AI-2activity, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), and extracellular protein contentof V. parahaemolyticus. Fluorescence microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images demonstrated that the Z057-E could efficiently inactivate the livingcells, destroy the dense and complete biofilm architectures, and reduce theessential component of the extracellular polymer matrix. Real-time fluorescencequantitative PCR revealed that the Z057-E treatment down-regulated the expressionof flagellum synthesis-related genes (flaA, flgM), EPS, and extracellular proteinsynthesis-related genes (cpsA, cpsQ, cpsR, ompW), QS-related genes (luxS, aphA,opaR), and hemolysin secretion-related genes (toxS, toxR) of V. parahaemolyticus.Thus, our results suggested that L. plantarum Z057 could represent an alternativebiocontrol strategy against foodborne pathogens with anti-adhesive, antibiofilm, and antiquorum sensing activities.

TI  - Synthesis and Properties of Hydrogels on Medical Titanium Alloy Surface byModified Dopamine Adhesion.
LID - 458 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/gels8080458 [doi]
AB  - Medical titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) is an ideal surgical implant material for human tissue repair and replacement. TC4 implantation will be in close contactwith human soft tissue and has mechanical compatibility problems. In order tosolve this problem, the hydrogel was formed on the surface of TC4 by utilizingthe adhesion of dopamine, and the storage modulus of the formed hydrogel matched that of human soft tissue. In this paper, the surface of TC4 was first modifiedwith dopamine (DA) and 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB). 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate (MEO2MA), oligo (ethylene oxide) methacrylate (OEGMA) and2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) are used as monomers, andmethylenebisacrylamide (MBA) is used as cross-linking agent. Thermosensitivehydrogels were formed on the surface of modified TC4 by the ATRP technique. Thesuccessful synthesis of initiator and hydrogels on TC4 was demonstrated byFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).The morphology of the hydrogel was observed by the scanning electron microscope(SEM), and the water absorption and temperature sensitivity were investigated by the swelling property. The thermal and mechanical properties of these gels weremeasured using thermal analysis system (TAS) and dynamic mechanical analyzer(DMA). The results show that the hydrogel on TC4 has good thermal stability andstorage modulus that matches human soft tissue.

TI  - Simultaneous Observation of Mouse Cortical and Hippocampal Neural Dynamics under Anesthesia through a Cranial Microprism Window.
LID - 567 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12080567 [doi]
AB  - The fluorescence microscope has been widely used to explore dynamic processes in vivo in mouse brains, with advantages of a large field-of-view and highspatiotemporal resolution. However, owing to background light and tissuescattering, the single-photon wide-field microscope fails to record dynamicneural activities in the deep brain. To achieve simultaneous imaging ofdeep-brain regions and the superficial cortex, we combined theextended-field-of-view microscopy previously proposed with a novel prism-basedcranial window to provide a longitudinal view. As well as a right-anglemicroprism for imaging above 1 mm, we also designed a new rectangular-trapezoidalmicroprism cranial window to extend the depth of observation to 1.5 mm and toreduce brain injury. We validated our method with structural imaging of microgliacells in the superficial cortex and deep-brain regions. We also recorded neuronalactivity from the mouse brains in awake and anesthesitized states. The resultshighlight the great potential of our methods for simultaneous dynamic imaging in the superficial and deep layers of mouse brains.

AB  - Enterococcus species possess many virulence factors that have an essential rolein exacerbating the infections caused by them. The current study aimed toevaluate the effect of the secondary metabolites ginkgetin (GINK) andsotetsuflavone (SOTE), isolated from Cycas media R. Br dichloromethane fraction, on Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) isolates for the first time. Theantibacterial and antivirulence activities of the isolated compounds wereinvestigated using docking studies and in vitro by determination of the minimuminhibitory concentrations (MICs). Additionally, flow cytometry and scanningelectron microscope (SEM) were utilized to assess the effect of SOTE on thetested bacteria. Moreover, crystal violet assay and qRT-PCR were used to test theeffect of SOTE on the biofilm-forming ability of E. faecalis isolates. Inaddition, a systemic infection model was utilized in vivo to investigate theantibacterial activity of SOTE. We found that both GINK and SOTE showed a goodaffinity for the five proteins enrolled in the virulence of E. faecalis, withSOTE being the highest, suggesting the possible mechanisms for the antivirulence activity of both ligands. In addition, SOTE exhibited a higher antibacterialactivity than GINK, as the values of the MICs of SOTE were lower than those ofGINK. Thus, we performed the in vitro and in vivo assays on SOTE. However, theydid not exhibit any significant variations (p &gt; 0.05) in the membranedepolarization of E. faecalis isolates. Moreover, as evaluated by SEM, SOTEcaused distortion and deformation in the treated cells. Regarding its impact onthe biofilm formation, it inhibited the biofilm-forming ability of the testedisolates, as determined by crystal violet assay and qRT-PCR. The in vivoexperiment revealed that SOTE resulted in a reduction of the inflammation of the liver and spleen with an increase in the survival rate. SOTE also improved theliver-function tests and decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha usingimmunostaining and the inflammation markers, interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-6),using ELISA. Thus, we can conclude that SOTE could be a promising compound thatshould be investigated in future preclinical and clinical studies.

TI  - Spaghetti Tracer: A Framework for Tracing Semiregular Filamentous Densities in 3DTomograms.
LID - 1022 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12081022 [doi]
AB  - Within cells, cytoskeletal filaments are often arranged into loosely alignedbundles. These fibrous bundles are dense enough to exhibit a certain regularityand mean direction, however, their packing is not sufficient to impose a symmetrybetween-or specific shape on-individual filaments. This intermediate regularityis computationally difficult to handle because individual filaments have acertain directional freedom, however, the filament densities are not wellsegmented from each other (especially in the presence of noise, such as incryo-electron tomography). In this paper, we develop a dynamic programming-based framework, Spaghetti Tracer, to characterizing the structural arrangement offilaments in the challenging 3D maps of subcellular components. Assuming that thetomogram can be rotated such that the filaments are oriented in a mean direction,the proposed framework first identifies local seed points for candidate filament segments, which are then grown from the seeds using a dynamic programmingalgorithm. We validate various algorithmic variations of our framework onsimulated tomograms that closely mimic the noise and appearance of experimentalmaps. As we know the ground truth in the simulated tomograms, the statisticalanalysis consisting of precision, recall, and F1 scores allows us to optimize theperformance of this new approach. We find that a bipyramidal accumulation scheme for path density is superior to straight-line accumulation. In addition, themultiplication of forward and backward path densities provides for an efficientfilter that lifts the filament density above the noise level. Resulting from our tests is a robust method that can be expected to perform well (F1 scores0.86-0.95) under experimental noise conditions.

AB  - Background: The most common polymers in the treatment of wounds are natural(e.g., polysaccharides, proteins, and peptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g.,poly-glycolic acid, polyacrylic acid, polylactic acid, and polyvinyl alcohol) dueto their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and their structural resemblance to the macromolecules known to the human body. Objectives: The current study aimedto develop an electrospinning method using the nanofibers of polyvinyl alcohol(PVA)/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)/polyamide amine (PAMAM)/tetracycline (Tet) tocover the wound. The antibacterial effect of PAMAM was also tested against E.coli and S. aureus bacteria. Materials and Methods: The morphology of thecomposite nanofiber was studied by a field emission scanning electron microscope.Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the nano chemicalstructure. Results: Nanofibers were evaluated based on the release of differentamounts of the antibiotic tetracycline (1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% by weight) whilepreventing wound infection. The findings indicated that the highest-profilerelease of all nanofibers occurred early within 12 hours. It was found thatnanofiber membranes loaded with 1%, 3%, and 5% tetracycline released drugs forover 28 days, while those containing 7% tetracycline released drugs for more than14 days. Conclusions: According to the findings related to the drug release ofPVA/CMC/15% PAMAM/Tet and surface morphology of the nanofibers, the optimalamount of Tet was 5%. The results of FTIR spectroscopy indicated that thetetracycline and polyamidoamine were successfully placed in nanofibers.

AB  - Cancer is one of the most serious diseases facing humanity; accordingly, it isurgent to find a cure that is rarely harmful to the patient as much as possible. It has been approved that arginine deiminase (ADI) can hydrolyze the plasmaarginine to citrulline. This hydrolysis activity and reduction in the amount ofintercellular arginine suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxidesynthesis. On the other hand, arginine depletion arrests the cell cycle at the G1phase; therefore, ADI has been considered a powerful anticancer agent. Thecurrent study aimed to investigate the lethal effects of ADI purified from theLactobacillus plantarum p5 strain on murine mammary adenocarcinoma and Vero cell lines. Anti-proliferative activity of ADI against murine mammary adenocarcinoma) AMN3) cell line was evaluated after different incubation times (3, 6, 24, 48, and72 h) of exposure to 1 microg/mL of ADI, compared to Vero (non-cancer cell line) transformed cell line with same conditions. The autophagy process in cancer cellswas recognized after three hours of incubation with ADI which was clearlyobserved in the AMN3 cell line under an inverted microscope. The first stages of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathway were only observed in AMN3 cellsafter 24 h of incubation with ADI, and this process continued with the time untilthey reached the last stages of apoptosis after 72 h of incubation. The resultsof the current study showed that the AMN3 cell line was auxotrophic for arginine because it could not produce it in the presence of enzyme which had a robustactivity to kill these cancer cells; however, Vero non-cancer cell line survived in the presence of ADI because it had the ability to produce arginine.

TI  - Role of Salvia officinalis Silver Nanoparticles in Attenuation Renal Damage inRabbits Exposed to Methotrexate.
PG  - 151-162
LID - 10.22092/ari.2021.356313.1821 [doi]
AB  - Nanomaterials are now considered in an extensive range of applications in variousfields such as biotechnology and biomedicine. The present study aimed toinvestigate the protective role of Salvia officinalis Silver Nanoparticles(SOSNPs) as an anti-oxidant on nephrotic damage induced by methotrexate (MTX) in adult rabbits. Green silver nanoparticles were synthesized using alcoholicextract of Salvia officinalis (S. Officinalis) leaves and were characterized byUV-spectrophotometry and scanning electron microscope. The mixing of the plantextract of S. Officinalis with silver nitrate solution leads to the change of thereaction mixture color to yellowish within 1 h and dark brown after 8 h. Forstudying the protective role of SOSNPs, a total of 28 adult Wistar albino rabbitswere divided into four groups and treated intramuscularly (twice per week) for 45days as follows: T1: S. Officinalis (150 mg/kg B.W), T2: SOSNPs (150 mg/kg B.W); T3: MTX (0.25 mg/kg B.W) and SOSNPs (150 mg/kg B.W); T4: MTX (0.25 mg/kg B.W).Blood was collected at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days using retro-orbital sinus andcardiac puncture technique, and the serum factors including malondialdehyde(MDA), glutathione (GSH) in serum, creatinine, as well as blood urea nitrogen anduric acid concentrations were measured at the next step. The results indicatedthat MTX (T4) caused a case of oxidative stress by a significant decrease in GSH and MDA as well as an increase in serum creatinine, urea, and uric acidconcentrations. On the other hand, the protective roles of S. Officinalis andSOSNPs given concurrently with MTX were clarified in T2 and T3 groups, wherethere was the alleviation of renal damage through the correction of thepreviously mentioned parameters as well as the correction of anti-oxidant status.Finally, the present study documented the anti-oxidant activity and renalprotective effects of SOSNPs against the damaging effects of MTX in rabbits.

TI  - Platelet-rich plasma pretreatment protects anterior cruciate ligament fibroblastscorrelated with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway under hypoxia condition.
PG  - 102-112
LID - 10.1016/j.jot.2022.02.002 [doi]
AB  - Background: /Objective: Biological factors such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP)combined with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) primary repair technology are usedto treat ACL injury. However, the protective mechanism of PRP for ACL fibroblastsunder hypoxia condition is still unknown. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the protective effect of PRP on ACL fibroblasts under hypoxiacondition and illustrate the mechanism of PRP regulating the ACL fibroblastsunder hypoxia condition. Methods: The cells were divided into three groups:control group, hypoxia group and PRP pretreatment group. Lethal dose (LD) 50 for hypoxia induction time and the maximum efficacy of PRP concentration wereconfirmed by CCK-8 assay. The ability of cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell migration were tested by flow cytometry, scratch assay and transwell assay, respectively. Extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and hypoxia-inducible factor1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were identified by immunofluorescence staining, Masson'sstaining and transmission electron microscope analysis. Inflammatory cellinfiltration was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining as well asimmunofluorescence staining. Western blot analysis and real-time PCR wereperformed to assess the associated gene and protein expression, respectively. Theratio of phosphorylated/total PI3K, Akt and mTOR were also assessed by westernblot analysis. Results: 1 in circle LD 50 of hypoxia was 48 h and the maximumefficacy of PRP concentration was 600 x 10(9)/L. 2 in circle ANNEXIN V-FITC/PIflow cytometry showed that the hypoxia condition significantly increased theapoptosis of cells (P < 0.001) whereas PRP pretreatment significantly decreasedthe apoptosis of cells under hypoxia (P < 0.001). The expressions of gene andprotein of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved-caspase 3 were consistent with the results of flowcytometric analysis. 3 in circle Cell cycle analysis for flow cytometry showedthe inhibitory effect of hypoxia and promotive effect of PRP pretreatment. 4 incircle Immunofluorescence staining (HIF-1alpha, collagen I and III) showed thepositive effect of hypoxia and negative effect of PRP on these parameters.Real-time PCR showed that type I and III collagen were 2.1 folds and 2.5 foldshigher after 48 h hypoxia induction compared to the control group. PRPpretreatment significantly reduced the type I and III collagen mRNA expression ofthe hypoxia induced ACL fibroblasts to 78.5% and 77.7% at 48 h compared tohypoxia group (P < 0.001), respectively. Cell migration assay showed that hypoxiacondition significantly restrained cell migration compared with the controlgroup. PRP could alleviate the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on fibroblasts.Western blot analysis showed the ratio of phosphorylated/total PI3K, Akt and mTORin hypoxia group increased to 31%, 20% and 44/% compared to control group,respectively. The results of in vivo analysis was in accordance with the results of in vitro analysis. Conclusion: PRP can protect ACL fibroblasts via decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell viability, cell migration and cell proliferationunder hypoxia condition. And such PRP protective effect was correlated withPI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The translational potential of this article: PRP can beused to treat patients with ACL tear by injection under arthroscopy or ultrasoundguiding.

LID - 10.3390/s22145201 [doi]
AB  - Cleaning is an important task that is practiced in every domain and has primeimportance. The significance of cleaning has led to several newfangledtechnologies in the domestic and professional cleaning domain. However,strategies for auditing the cleanliness delivered by the various cleaning methodsremain manual and often ignored. This work presents a novel domestic dirt imagedataset for cleaning auditing application including AI-based dirt analysis androbot-assisted cleaning inspection. One of the significant challenges in anAI-based robot-aided cleaning auditing is the absence of a comprehensive dataset for dirt analysis. We bridge this gap by identifying nine classes of commonlyoccurring domestic dirt and a labeled dataset consisting of 3000 microscope dirt images curated from a semi-indoor environment. The dirt dataset gathered usingthe adhesive dirt lifting method can enhance the current dirt sensing and dirtcomposition estimation for cleaning auditing. The dataset's quality is analyzedby AI-based dirt analysis and a robot-aided cleaning auditing task using sixstandard classification models. The models trained with the dirt dataset werecapable of yielding a classification accuracy above 90% in the offline dirtanalysis experiment and 82% in real-time test results.

TI  - Progressive Damage Behaviour Analysis and Comparison with 2D/3D Hashin FailureModels on Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Aluminium Laminates.
LID - 2946 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142946 [doi]
AB  - It is known that carbon fibre-reinforced aluminium laminate is the thirdgeneration of fibre metal materials. This study investigates the response ofcarbon fibre-reinforced aluminium laminates (CARALL) under tensile loading andthree-point bending tests, which evaluate the damage initiation and propagationmechanism. The 2D Hashin and 3D Hashin VUMAT models are used to analyse andcompare each composite layer for finite element modelling. A bilinear cohesivecontact model is modelled for the interface failure, and the Johnson cook modeldescribes the aluminium layer. The mechanical response and failure analysis ofCARALL were evaluated using load versus deflection curves, and the scanningelectron microscope was adopted. The results revealed that the failure modes ofCARALL were mainly observed in the aluminium layer fracture, fibre pull-out,fracture, and matrix tensile fracture under tensile and flexural loadingconditions. The 2D Hashin and 3D Hashin models were similar in predicting tensileproperties, flexural properties, mechanical response before peak load points, andfinal failure modes. It is highlighted that the 3D Hashin model can accuratelyreveal the failure mechanism and failure propagation mechanism of CARALL.

AB  - Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) is an alternative material for use in removablepartial denture frameworks; these frameworks must exhibit antibacterialproperties to reduce the risk of periodontal disease. In the present study,silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized via the reduction of silver nitratewith sodium borohydride in a solution containing polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP).Transmission electron microscope images and dynamic light scattering confirmedthat metallic nanoparticles had been created with an average size of 32 nm.Furthermore, the coating of the PEKK polymeric substrate with 0.5% AgNPs wascarried out using an epoxy resin lining at room temperature. Fourier transforminfrared (FTIR) spectra confirmed the successful transfer of the AgNP-in-resinlining onto the polymeric substrate. Scanning electron microscopy and atomicforce microscopy confirmed that the AgNPs had been uniformly deposited onto thePEKK specimens. Finally, the antibacterial activity of the specimens was testedagainst Porphyromonas gingivalis. An inhibition zone of 22.5 mm and anantibacterial rate of 83.47% were found for the PEKK coated with 0.5% AgNPs (0.5%Ag-PEKK) compared to an untreated polyetheretherketone (PEEK) substrate,evidencing that 0.5% Ag-PEKK has potential antibacterial properties for implantapplications.

TI  - The Dependence of the Properties of Recycled PET Electrospun Mats on the Originof the Material Used for Their Fabrication.

LID - 10.3390/polym14142881 [doi]
AB  - Plastic materials are one of the significant components of construction materialsomnipresent in all areas of the industry and everyday life. One of these plasticsis polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Due to its processing properties, with asimultaneous low production cost, PET has been used in many industrialapplications, including the production of various types of bottles. Moreover, thehigh consumption of PET bottles causes the accumulation of large amounts of theirwaste and necessitates finding an effective way to recycle them. Electrospinning is a well-known non-complicated method for the fabrication of nonwovens frompolymers and composites, which can be utilized in many fields due to theiroutstanding properties. In addition, it might be a promising technique for therecycling of plastic materials. Therefore, in this study, the electrospinningapproach for the recycling of two types of PET bottle wastes-bottles made ofvirgin PET and bottles made of recycled PET (PET bottles) has been utilized, and a comparison of the properties of the obtained materials have been performed. Thefibers with diameters of 1.62 +/- 0.22, 1.64 +/- 0.18, and 1.89 +/- 0.19 havebeen produced from solutions made of virgin PET granulate, PET bottles, and PETbottles made of recycled bottles, respectively. Obtained fibers underwentmorphological observation using a scanning electron microscope. Physico-chemical properties using FTIR, gel chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry have been evaluated, and mechanical properties of obtained mats have beeninvestigated. Cytotoxicity tests using the L929 mouse fibroblast cell linerevealed no cytotoxicity for all tested materials.

LID - 10.3390/polym14142827 [doi]
AB  - Recently, Strontium oxide (SrO) nanoparticles (NPs) and hybrids outperformedolder commercial catalysts in terms of catalytic performance. Herein, we present a microwave-assisted easy in situ solution casting approach for the manufactureof strontium oxide nanoparticles doped within a naturally occurring polymer,chitosan (CS), at varying weight percentages (2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.%SrO/chitosan). To construct the new hybrid material as a thin film, the produced nanocomposite solutions were cast in petri dishes. The aim of the research was tosynthesize these hybrid nanocomposites, characterize them, and evaluate theircatalytic potential in a variety of organic processes. The strontiumoxide-chitosan nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared(FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM)techniques. All the results confirmed the formation of chitosan-strontium oxidenanocomposite. FTIR spectrum of nanocomposite showed the presence of acharacteristic peak of Sr-O bond. Furthermore, XRD revealed that SrO treatmentincreased the crystallinity of chitosan. The particle size was calculated usingthe Debye-Scherrer formula, and it was determined to be around 36 nm. The CS-SrO nanocomposite has been proven to be a highly efficient base promoter for thesynthesis of 2-hydrazono [1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives. To optimize thecatalytic method, the reaction factors were investigated. The approach hasvarious advantages, including higher reaction yields, shorter reaction durations,and milder reaction conditions, as well as the catalyst's reusability for severalapplications.

TI  - Study of the Preparation and Properties of Chrysin Binary Functional MonomerMolecularly Imprinted Polymers.

LID - 10.3390/polym14142771 [doi]
AB  - Chrysin is a natural bioactive molecule with various groups, and it has been achallenge to separate and enrich chrysin from natural products. Molecularlyimprinted polymers have been widely used in the extraction of natural products,but the number and type of functional monomers limits the separation effect. The synergistic action of multiple functional monomers can improve the separationeffect. In this paper, molecularly imprinted polymers (Bi-MIPs) were preparedusing methacrylic acid and acrylamide as binary functional monomers for theseparation and enrichment of chrysin. The Bi-MIPs were characterized usingthermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The performances of Bi-MIPs wereassessed, which included adsorption isotherms, selective recognition andadsorption kinetics. The experimental results show that Bi-MIPs are shaped as auniform sphere with an abundant pocket structure on its surface. The adsorptionof chrysin on the Bi-MIPs followed a pseudo-second-order and adaptedLangmuir-Freundlich isotherm models. The adsorption performance of the Bi-MIPswas determined at different temperatures, and the Bi-MIPs showed excellentadsorption performance at 30 degrees C. The initial decomposition temperature of the Bi-MIPs was 220 degrees C. After five times of adsorption and desorption, theadsorption performance of the Bi-MIPs decreased by only 7%. In contrast withsingle functional monomer molecularly imprinted polymers (Si-MIPs), the Bi-MIPsshowed excellent specificity, with an imprinting factor of 1.54. The Bi-MIPs are promising materials in the separation and enrichment of chrysin for their highadsorption capacity, low cost and being environmentally friendly.

TI  - Study on Carbonization Characteristics and Deterioration Mechanism of RecycledConcrete with Tailings and Polypropylene Fiber.
LID - 2758 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142758 [doi]
AB  - To improve the deformation performance of recycled concrete with tailings (TRC), its carbonization characteristics and deterioration mechanism with differentpolypropylene fiber content were analyzed macroscopically and microscopically.The results showed that the fiber had little effect on the compressive strength, which increased first and then decreased, with the optimum content being 0.6%.The splitting tensile strength first increased and then tended to be stable, withthe optimum dosage ranging from 0.6% to 0.9%. The more the content, the higherthe peak strain and the lower the elastic modulus. The rising section of itsconstitutive curve changed little, while the falling section became more gentle. Carbonization made the relative dynamic elastic modulus change small with a trendof first increasing and then decreasing, and the optimum content was 0.6-0.9%.When the fiber content was small, the influence on the carbonization depth didnot remain significant, but when it was large, the depth increased obviously, andthis critical content was about 0.6%. Microscopically, through nuclear-magneticresonance (NMR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, due to thestrong tensioning effect of the fiber, when a small amount was added, theporosity and pore structure had not been significantly changed, so the impact on its resistance to carbonization was not obvious. However, after excessiveaddition, the interface transition zone (ITZ) between different materials became larger, resulting in a significant increase of its harmful cracks and a greatimpact on the anti-carbonization ability, with the optimal content being about0.6%. This study provides a theoretical reference for the deformation performanceimprovement measure of TRC, which would be helpful for the rapid promotion andapplication of green concrete in engineering practice.

AB  - We detected tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a member of the genus Tobamovirus and oneof the most significant plant-infecting viruses, for the first time in achrysanthemum in Thailand using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The TMV-infected chrysanthemum leaves exhibited mosaic symptoms. Weconducted a sequence analysis of the coat protein (CP) gene and found that theTMV detected in the chrysanthemum had 98% identity with other TMV isolates inGenBank. We carried out bioassays and showed that TMV induced mosaic and stuntingsymptoms in inoculated chrysanthemums. We observed the rigid rod structure of TMVunder a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To enhance the speed andsensitivity of detection, we developed a colorimetric RT loop-mediated isothermalamplification (LAMP) technique. We achieved LAMP detection after 30 minincubation in isothermal conditions at 65 degrees C, and distinguished thepositive results according to the color change from pink to yellow. Thesensitivity of the LAMP technique was 1000-fold greater than that of RT-PCR, and we found no cross-reactivity with other viruses or viroids. This is the firstreported case of a TMV-infected chrysanthemum in Thailand, and our colorimetricRT-LAMP TMV detection method is the first of its kind.

AB  - Purpureocillium lavendulum is a biological control agent with several registered products that can parasitize the eggs and larvae of various pathogenic nematodes.In this study, the pathogenicity and secondary metabolites of the fungus P.lavendulum YMF1.00683 were investigated. The strain YMF1.00683 had infectionefficiency against the plant root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Thestrain's process of infecting nematodes was observed under a microscope.Moreover, seven metabolites, including a new sterol (1), were isolated andidentified from cultures of YMF1.0068 in Sabouraud's dextrose agar. A bioassayshowed that 5-methoxymethyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (7) is toxic to M.incognita and affects the egg hatching. It caused 98.23% mortality in M.incognita and could inhibit 80.78% of the hatching eggs at 400 mug/mL over aperiod of 96 h. Furthermore, 5-methoxymethyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (7)showed a strong avoidance effect at 40 ppm, and its chemotactic index value was-0.37. The results indicate that P. lavendulum could produce active metabolitesagainst M. incognita.

LID - 10.3390/nano12142354 [doi]
AB  - A simple electrochemical sensor for nicotine (NIC) detection was performed. Thesensor based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified by(1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulphonic acid)(Nq) decorated by graphene oxide (GO)nanocomposite. The synthesized (GO) nanosheets were characterized using X-raydiffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM),transmission electron microscope (TEM), FT-IR, and UV-Visible Spectroscopy. Theinsertion of Nq with GO nanosheets on the surface of GCE displayed highelectrocatalytic activity towards NIC compared to the bare GCE. NIC determinationwas performed under the optimum conditions using 0.10 M of Na2SO4 as a supportingelectrolyte with pH 8.0 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s using both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). This electrochemical sensor showedan excellent result for NIC detection. The oxidation peak current increasedlinearly with a 6.5-245 microM of NIC with R(2) = 0.9999. The limit of detection was 12.7 nM. The fabricated electrode provided satisfactory stability,reproducibility, and selectivity for NIC oxidation. The reliable GO/Nq/GCE sensorwas successfully applied for detecting NIC in the tobacco product and a urinesample.

AB  - The temperature of advanced components in aviation and aerospace fields isdifficult to obtain timely. In this study, we aimed to investigate microwavebackscattering technology combined with the theory of substrate integratedwaveguide and resonant cavity to design a wireless passive temperature sensor andexplore its potential in this field. We employed silicon carbide and aluminumceramic as the substrate to make sensors. The interrogation antenna was designed to test the sensor, which could completely cover the working frequency of thesensor and had good radiation characteristics. Based on the test results, thesilicon carbide sensor was capable of bearing a temperature limit of about 1000degrees C compared to the alumina sensor. From 25 degrees C to 500 degrees C, itssensitivity was 73.68 kHz/ degrees C. Furthermore, the sensitivity was 440 kHz/degrees C in the range of 501 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. Moreover, we observed the surface of this sensor by using the scanning electron microscope, and theresults showed that the damage to the sensor surface film structure caused bylong-term high temperature is the major reason for the failure of the sensor. In conclusion, the performance of the silicon carbide sensor is superior to thealumina sensor.

TI  - Use of PtC Nanotips for Low-Voltage Quantum Tunneling Applications.
LID - 1019 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071019 [doi]
AB  - The use of focused ion and focused electron beam (FIB/FEB) technology permits thefabrication of micro- and nanometer scale geometries. Therefore, FIB/FEBtechnology is a favorable technique for preparing TEM lamellae, nanocontacts, or nanowires and repairing electronic circuits. This work investigates FIB/FEBtechnology as a tool for nanotip fabrication and quantum mechanical tunnelingapplications at a low tunneling voltage. Using a gas injection system (GIS), the Ga-FIB and FEB technology allows both additive and subtractive fabrication ofarbitrary structures. Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),resistance measurement (RM), and scanning tunneling microscope (STM)/spectroscopy(STS) methods, the tunneling suitability of the utilized metal-organicmaterial-platinum carbon (PtC) is investigated. Thus, to create electrode tipswith radii down to 15 nm, a stable and reproducible process has to be developed. The metal-organic microstructure analysis shows suitable FIB parameters for thetunneling effect at high aperture currents (260 pA, 30 kV). These are required toensure the suitability of the electrodes for the tunneling effect by an increasedplatinum content (EDX), a low resistivity (RM), and a small band gap (STM). TheSTM application allows the imaging of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)layers and demonstrates the tunneling suitability of PtC electrodes based on highFIB aperture currents and a low tunneling voltage.

TI  - High-Precision Regulation of Nano-Grating Linewidth Based on ALD.
LID - 995 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13070995 [doi]
AB  - A nano-grating standard with accurate linewidth can not only calibrate themagnification of nano-measurement instruments, but can also enable comparison of linewidths. Unfortunately, it is still a challenging task to control thelinewidth of nano-grating standards. Accordingly, in this paper, atomic layerdeposition (ALD) was used to regulate the linewidth of the one-dimensionalgrating standards with a pitch of 1000 nm, fabricated by electron beamlithography (EBL). The standards were measured using an atomic force microscope(AFM) before and after ALD, and the linewidth and pitch of the grating werecalculated through the gravity center method. The obtained results prove that thewidth of a single grating line in the standard can be regulated with greatuniformity by precisely utilizing ALD. Meanwhile, the proposed method does notaffect the pitch of grating, and the measurement uncertainty of standards is lessthan 0.16% of the pitch, thereby demonstrating a high surface quality andcalibration reliability of the standards, and realizing the integration oflinewidth and pitch calibration functions. Moreover, the precise and controllablefabrication method of the micro-nano periodic structure based on ALD technologyhas many potential applications in the fields of optoelectronic devices andbiosensors.

TI  - Evaluating the Phagocytic Index of Peripheral Leukocytes in Endometriosis byPlasma Experiments.

LID - 10.3390/medicina58070925 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Endometriosis is a benign, chronic disease, thatnegatively influences the quality of life of affected women and is responsiblefor a remarkable amount of infertility. The pathophysiology of the disease isstill not clarified, but the insufficient immune surveillance plays a significantrole in it. The phagocyte function of innate immune cells may play a role in the elimination of ectopic endometrium. The purpose of this study is to examine thephagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes, incubated inheat-inactivated and not-inactivated plasma samples from healthy women and fromwomen with endometriosis before and after the surgical treatment. Materials andMethods: Blood samples were collected from eight preoperative and eightpostoperative patients with endometriosis before and after the surgicaltreatment, and from 16 healthy patients as controls. Neutrophil granulocytes,monocytes and blood plasma samples were isolated. Cells were incubated indifferent plasma samples, and the phagocytic index was determined with afluorescence microscope. Results: The phagocytic index of granulocytes andmonocytes isolated from patients with endometriosis was significantly decreasedcompared to healthy women after the cells were incubated in their own plasma.Preoperatively isolated cells from patients with endometriosis demonstrated animproved phagocyte function after incubating them in plasma samples from healthy controls. In contrast, the phagocytic activity of cells from healthy womensignificantly reduced after being incubated in the plasma of preoperativeendometriosis patients. The heat-inactivation of plasma samples did not affectthe results. Conclusions: Active endometriosis lesions may produce heat-stablesystemic immunomodulatory factors, which reduced the phagocyte function ofperipheral monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes. The phagocyte function of thesecells can be normalized after the complete surgical removal of endometriosis,which then demonstrates similar values as in healthy women.

TI  - Horizontal Oxidation Diffusion Behavior of MEMS-Based Tungsten-Rhenium Thin Film Thermocouples.

LID - 10.3390/ma15145071 [doi]
AB  - Tungsten-rhenium thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) are well suited for the surface temperature monitoring of hot components due to their small size, rapid response and low cost. In this study, a tungsten-rhenium TFTC with SiC protective film on all parts except the pads was fabricated by a microelectromechanical system(MEMS) process. During the low to medium temperature (-40 degrees C to 500degrees C) repeatability test phase, the thermal voltage from the TFTC agreedwell with that of the standard tungsten-rhenium thermocouple. However, during thehigh temperature test phase, the TFTC lost electronic response at around 620degrees C. Failure analysis of the TFTC tested at 620 degrees C was performed by microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy(EDS), laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and statistics. The resultsshowed that the pads were oxidized without the protective layer, the number ofoxidized protrusions distributed in this TFTC from the pad to the node decreases more and more slowly and the size of the oxidized protrusions also becomessmaller and smaller. This demonstrates the presence of horizontal oxidationdiffusion in TFTCs, further illustrating the importance of pad protection andprovides a direction for the subsequent structural optimization and the extensionof the service life of TFTCs and other sensors.

TI  - On the Sintering Behavior of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 Mixed Oxide Powders.
LID - 5036 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15145036 [doi]
AB  - A mixed oxide system consisting of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5, was subjected to annealing inair/hydrogen up to 950 degrees C for 1-4 h to study its sintering behavior. Thethermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) thermogramsindicated the formation of multiple endothermic peaks at temperatures higher than925 degrees C. Subsequently, a 30% Ta2O5 and 70% Nb2O5 (mol%) pellet resulted in good sintering behavior at both 900 and 950 degrees C. The scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) images corroborated these observations with necking and particlecoarsening. The sintered pellets contained a 20.4 and 20.8% mixed oxide(Nb4Ta2O15) phase, along with Ta2O5 and Nb2O5, at both 900 and 950 degrees C,indicating the possibility of the formation of a solid solution phase. In situhigh-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans also confirmed the formation ofthe ternary oxide phase at 6 and 19.8% at 890 and 950 degrees C, respectively.The Hume-Rothery rules could explain the good sintering behavior of the Ta2O5 andNb2O5 mixed oxides. An oxide composition of 30% Ta2O5 and 70% Nb2O5 (mol%) and a sintering temperature of 950 degrees C appeared adequate for fabricatingwell-sintered oxide precursors for subsequent electrochemical polarizationstudies in fused salts.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Microleakage of Flowable Composite Resin Using Etch andRinse, Self-Etch Adhesive Systems, and Self-Adhesive Flowable Composite Resin in Class V Cavities: Confocal Laser Microscopic Study.
LID - 4963 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144963 [doi]
AB  - The essential factor in determining the preservation of restoration is themarginal seal. Restoring cervical lesions with a resin composite has always been a challenge. Composite resins with various viscosities and different bondingsystems are being researched to reduce the microleakage. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is the latest non-destructive technique for visualizing themicroleakage. Objectives: To evaluate and compare the microleakage of UniversalFlo composite resin (G-aenial) using etch and rinse adhesive system ER-2 steps(Adper Single Bond 2), self-etch adhesive system SE-1 step (G-Bond), andself-adhesive flowable composite resin (Constic) in Class V cavities using aconfocal laser scanning microscope. Materials and Method: Class V cavities wereprepared on 27 caries-free human extracted premolar teeth on the buccal andlingual surfaces with standardized dimensions of 2 mm height, width 4 mm, and adepth of 2 mm. After the cavity preparation, all teeth were randomly divided intothree groups, namely Group-I: G-aenial Universal Flo with Single Bond 2 (n = 9teeth); Group-II: G- aenial Universal Flo with G-Bond (n = 9 teeth), andGroup-III: Constic (n = 9 teeth). The prepared and restored specimens were thensubjected to thermocycling for 500 cycles in a water bath at 5 degrees C and 55degrees C with a dwelling time of 30 s. The specimens were placed in 0.6% aqueousrhodamine dye for 48 h. Sectioning was carried out bucco-lingually and specimens were evaluated for microleakage under a confocal laser scanning microscope.Results: There was a significant difference (p = 0.009) in microleakage whencomparing total etch and rinse, specifically between Adper Single Bond 2 ER-2steps (fifth generation) and self-adhesive flowable composite resin, which isConstic. There was more microleakage in the self-etch bonding agent, particularlyG-Bond, SE-1 step (seventh generation), when compared to ER-2 steps (fifthgeneration bonding agent); however, the results were not statisticallysignificant (p = 0.468). The self-adhesive flowable composite resin showed moremicroleakage than SE-1 step and ER-2 steps. Conclusions: None of the adhesivesystems tested were free from microleakage. However, less microleakage wasobserved in the total etch and rinse, especially Adper Single Bond 2 (ER-2steps), than the self-etch adhesive system SE-1 step and self-adhesive flowablecomposite resin. Clinical significance: Constant research and technologicaladvancements are taking place in dentin adhesives to improve the marginal seal.This has led to the evolution of total acid-etching dentin bonding agents termed as etch and rinse (ER)-2 steps (fifth generation dentin bonding agents) andself-etching (SE) 2 steps, and SE-1 step dentin bonding agents termed as thesixth and seventh generation bonding agents, respectively.

AB  - Increasing demand for sustainable approaches to mining and raw materialextraction, has prompted the need to explore advanced methods of surfacemodification for structural steels used in the extractive industry. Thetechnology of powder plasma transferred arc welding (PPTAW), was used in thisstudy as a surface modification technique to improve upon the abrasive wearresistance of structural steel grade EN S355. PPTAW process parameters, namely,plasma transferred arc (PTA) current and plasma gas flow rate (PGFR), werevaried, and the effects of the variation were studied and used as criteria forselecting optimum conditions for further studies and parametric reproducibility. Two metal matrix composite (MMC) powders were used in the process, havingcompositions of Ni-Si-B+60 wt%WC (PG) and Ni-Cr-Si-B+45 wt%WC (PE).Microstructural observation under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed adendritic, multi-directional microstructure consisting of partially dissolvedprimary tungsten carbide particles and secondary tungsten carbide precipitateswithin the MMC solid solution. The hardness of the surface layers was higher thanthat of a reference AR400 steel by more than 263 HV. Final surface layersobtained from the MMC powders had abrasive wear resistance up to 5.7 times thatof abrasion-resistant reference AR400 steel. Alloying the MMC matrix withchromium increased the hardness by 29.4%. Under the same process conditions, MMC powder with 60 wt% WC reinforcement had better abrasive wear resistance by up to 45.8% more than the MMC powder with 45 wt% WC.

AB  - The study and development of the technological foundations for creating atextured surface using an electrode tool obtained by the method of additivemanufacturing are the purpose of the work. Methods for obtaining texturedsurfaces and for creating a tool electrode for electrical discharge machining areconsidered in this work. The modeling of the electrodetool, analysis of internal stresses during its manufacture by the selective laser melting method, and themanufacture of electrodes are considered. A Realizer SLM 50 laser machine wasused to create the electrode tool. Ti6Al4V metal powder with an average particle size of 30 microm was chosen as the material for manufacturing. The experimentswere carried out on a copy-piercing electrical discharge Smart CNC machine. Thematerial of the workpiece is corrosion-resistant, heat-resistant, high-alloysteel 15Cr12H2MoWVNNB. An Olympus GX 51 light microscope (Olympus Corporation,Shinjuku-ku, Japan) at 100x magnification was used to visually evaluate thetexturing results and measure dimensions. The possibility of using electrodesobtained by the selective laser melting method for texturing surfaces wasstudied.

TI  - Investigation of Cytotoxicity of Biosynthesized Colloidal Nanosilver againstLocal Leishmania tropica: In Vitro Study.
LID - 4880 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144880 [doi]
AB  - Leishmaniasis is one of the biggest health problems in the world. Traditionaltherapeutic methods still depend on a small range of products, mostly chemically.However, the treatment with these drugs is expensive and can cause seriousadverse effects, and they have inconsistent effectiveness due to the resistanceof parasites to these drugs. The treatment of leishmanial disease has always beena challenge for researchers. The development of nanoscale metals such as silverhas attracted significant attention in the field of medicine. The uniquecharacteristic features of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) make them effectiveantileishmanial agents. In recent years, green nanotechnology has provided thedevelopment of green nanoparticle-based treatment methods for Leishmaniasis.Although there are many studies based on green nanoparticles against Leishmaniaparasites, this is the first study on the antileishmanial effect ofbiosynthesized AgNPs using an aqueous extract of Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaves (AEECL) as a reducing agent of silver ions. Different parameters such as AgNO3concentration, AEECL concentration, and reaction time were studied to investigatethe optimum factors for the preparation of stable and small-sized silvernanoparticles. The spherical shape of colloidal nanosilver (CN-Ag) was confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imageswith sizes of 27 and 12 nm, respectively. A high density of nanoparticles with a small size of 10 nm has been confirmed from dynamic light scattering (DLS)analysis. The zeta potential value of 23 mV indicated that colloidal silvernanoparticles were stable. The nano-tracker analysis (NTA) showed the Brownianmotion of silver nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 31 nm. Theantioxidant property of CN-Ag was determined using the stable radical2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In this study, a significantcytotoxic effect of biosynthesized CN-Ag has been shown against Leishmaniatropica parasites at low concentrations (1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 microg/mL). Theseresults could be used as a future alternative drug or could be a supportivetreatment for Leishmaniasis.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Monolithic Zirconia Crowns Depending on Different MarginalThicknesses.
LID - 4861 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144861 [doi]
AB  - Under some clinical conditions, the preparation of crowns of limited marginalthickness is inevitable. In such situations, it is questionable whether the same ideal preparation criteria can be applied equally. Since there are only a smallnumber of studies focusing on the fracture resistance with respect to themarginal thickness, there is a need for a study evaluating whether zirconiacrowns of limited marginal thickness are clinically acceptable. The purpose ofthis study is to evaluate the fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crownsof limited marginal thickness in the posterior area. METHODS: Abutments andCAD/CAM zirconia crowns with a marginal thickness of 1.0 mm were set as thecontrol group, while experimental groups A, B, and C possessed reduced marginalthicknesses of 0.8 mm, 0.6 mm, and 0.4 mm, respectively (n = 10 per group).Resin-based abutment dies and monolithic zirconia crowns were fabricated usingthe CAD/CAM technique, and a universal testing machine was used to measure thefracture load value. Fractured specimens were examined with a scanning electronmicroscope. The data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: The means and standard deviations of the fractureload values of the control group and the three experimental groups were asfollows: control group (1.0 mm): 3090.91 +/- 527.77 N; group A (0.8 mm): 2645.39 +/- 329.21 N; group B (0.6 mm): 2256.85 +/- 454.15 N; group C (0.4 mm): 1957.8+/- 522.14 N. CONCLUSIONS: The crowns fabricated with a CAD/CAM zirconia blockwith limited marginal thicknesses of 0.6 mm and 0.4 mm showed significantly lowerfracture resistance values compared to those with the recommended marginthickness of 1.0 mm.

LID - 10.3390/ma15144850 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to compare three disinfection protocols ofbiofilm-coated machined (MAC) and acid etched (SLA) commercial pure Grade 4Titanium disks. Samples were infected with a vial of polymicrobial biofilm tosimulate peri-implantitis in vitro. Seventeen MAC and twenty SLA titanium diskswere randomly assigned to: (1) glycine powder air-flow (GYPAP) for 1 min; (2) alocal delivered triple paste antibiotic composed by a gel mixture withciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin (3MIX) for 1 h; and (3) acombination of both (GYPAP + 3MIX). Biocompatibility of the titanium disks after each treatment protocol was assessed by measurement of adhesion and growth ofadipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) after 24 and 72 h. A confocal laserscanning microscope (CLSM) assessed the antibacterial effect of each treatment.Data of the antibacterial efficacy and cell viability were presented as mean withstandard deviation and calculated by one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via Bonferroni tests. Results were considered significant with p &lt; 0.05. Thehigher cell viability was achieved by the 3MIX and GYPAP combination on the SLAsurfaces after 72 h. CLSM analysis showed a mean ratio of dead bacteriastatistically higher in the 3MIX + GYPAP group compared with the GYPAP and 3MIXsubgroups (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, data showed that the combination of GYPAPand 3MIX could be preferred to the other protocols, especially in presence of SLAtitanium surface.

AB  - Light-weight metal matrix composites, especially magnesium-based composites, haverecently become more widespread for high-efficiency applications, includingaerospace, automobile, defense, and telecommunication industries. The squeezecast AZ91 base material (AZ91-BM) and its composites having 23 vol.% short carbonfibers were fabricated and investigated. The composite specimens were machinednormal to the reinforced plane (Composite-N) and parallel to the reinforced plane(Composite-P). All the as-casted materials were subjected to different tests,such as hardness, compression, and wear testing, evaluating the mechanicalproperties. Dry wear tests were performed using a pin-on-disk machine at roomtemperature under different applied wear loads (1-5 N) and different slidingdistances (0.4461x104-3.12x104 m). The microstructures and worn surfaces of thefabricated AZ91-BM and the two composite specimens were investigated using ascanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersivespectroscopy (EDS) advanced analysis system. The wear debris was collected andinvestigated also under the SEM. The results showed significant improvement inhardness, compressive strength, and wear resistance of the composite specimens(Composite-N and Composite-P) over the AZ91-BM. The compressive strength and wearresistance are more fibers orientation sensitive than the hardness results. When the fiber orientation is parallel to the sliding direction (Composite-N), theweight loss is somewhat lower than that of the fiber orientation perpendicular tothe sliding direction (Composite-P) at a constant wear load of 2 N and thesliding distances of 0.4461x104, 1.34x104&amp;nbsp;, and 2.23x104 m. In contrast,the weight loss of Composite-P is lower than Composite-N, especially at thehighest sliding distance of 3.12x104 m due to the continuous feeding of graphite lubricant film and the higher compressive strength. Plastic deformation,oxidation, and abrasive wear are the dominant wear mechanisms of AZ91-BM; incontrast, abrasive and delamination wear are mainly the wear mechanisms of thetwo composites under the applied testing conditions.

LID - 4840 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144840 [doi]
AB  - To meet the needs of the road industry for maintenance operations, a new cementemulsified bitumen mixture (CEBM) with early-strength, self-compacting, androom-temperature construction characteristics was designed. The strengthformation mechanism of CEBM was revealed with a scanning electron microscope(SEM) and the surface free energy (SFE) theory. The mechanical properties androad performance of the CEBM were investigated extensively. The results show thatbefore the demulsification of emulsified bitumen, the SFE of thebitumen-aggregate-water three-phase system was reduced due to the replacement of the bitumen-aggregate interface with water. The adhesion work between theemulsified bitumen and the aggregate is negative, which means the adhesionbetween the emulsified bitumen and the aggregate will not occur spontaneously dueto the existence of water. The liquid emulsified bitumen improves the workabilityof the mixture and ensures that the mixture can be evenly mixed andself-compacted. After demulsification, the work of adhesion between the residual bitumen and the aggregate is positive, which means residual bitumen and aggregatecan bond spontaneously. In addition, the hydration products of cement andaggregate form a skeleton, and the emulsified bitumen film wraps and bonds thecement and aggregate together, creating strength. The emulsified bitumen, cement content, and curing conditions have significant effects on the stability of CEBM.The recommended dosage of emulsified bitumen and cement is 8% and 8-10%,respectively. This material integrates the hardening effect of cement and theviscoelastic performance of bitumen and has good workability, mechanicalproperties, and road performance. Therefore, the CEBM is technically feasible forapplication to bitumen pavement.

TI  - Promotion Effect of Carboxymethyl Chitosan on Dental Caries via IntrafibrillarMineralization of Collagen and Dentin Remineralization.
LID - 4835 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144835 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe ultrastructural changes during the process of carboxymethylchitosan (CMC)-mediated intrafibrillar mineralization, we evaluated thebiomimetic remineralization potential of CMC in type-I collagen fibrils andmembranes, and further explored the bond strength as well as the bond interfacialintegrity of the biomimetic remineralized artificial caries-affected dentin(ACAD). METHODS: A mineralized solution containing 200 mug/mL CMC was used toinduce type-I collagen biomimetic remineralization in ACAD, while traditionalmineralization without CMC was used as a control. The process and pattern ofmineralization were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS) as well as structured illumination microscopy (SIM). The Vickers hardnesstest was used to quantify the dentin hardness, while the microtensile bondstrength (microTBS) test was used to assess the bond strength and durability. Thebond interfacial integrity was evaluated by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). RESULTS: TEM, SEM, and SIM images showed that CMC had a positive effecton stabilizing amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and promoting intrafibrillarmineralization, while extrafibrillar mineralization was formed without CMC.Furthermore, hardness evaluation and microTBS proved that CMC significantlyincreased dentin hardness and bond strength. CLSM indicated that CMC could createa significantly better bond interfacial integrity with less of a micro-gap inACAD. SIGNIFICANCE: CMC possessed the ability to promote intrafibrillarmineralization and remineralization in demineralized caries dentin lesions, aswell as improve bond performance, which implied its potential in carious dentindemineralization or dentin hypersensitivity and possibly even as a possiblematerial for indirect pulp-capping, to deal with deep caries. HIGHLIGHTS: CMCpossessed the ability to induce intrafibrillar mineralization effectively; thebond strength and bond durability of demineralized caries dentin were improvedvia CMC-induced remineralization; the CMC-induced remineralization complex is apotential material for indirect pulp-capping, to deal with deep caries.

LID - 10.3390/ma15144799 [doi]
AB  - To improve the flexural properties of cemented soils reinforced with fibers andavoid their brittle failure when subjected to complex loading conditions, asimple and cost-effective technique was explored to facilitate their application in retaining walls. In this study, how different fiber surface modifications,i.e., alkali treatment, acid treatment and silane coupling agent treatment, aswell as different fiber contents, i.e., 0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%, affect thebending properties of cemented soils was investigated by conducting three-pointbending tests on notched beams. The digital image correlation (DIC) technologywas used to examine the crack propagation process and the strain fielddistribution of cracks in specimens in the flexural tests. The results show that all fiber surface modifications increased peak strength and fracture energy, for example, the fracture energy of specimens AN1, AH1 and AK1 was increased by180.4%, 121.5% and 155.4%, respectively, compared to PVA1. In addition, the cracktip strain, crack propagation rate and the initial crack width of the modifiedspecimens were lower than those before modification. Lastly, scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests were adopted to revealthe mechanism of bending performance in cemented soils reinforced by fibersurface modifications.

LID - 10.3390/ma15144788 [doi]
AB  - A complex concentrated noble alloy (CCNA) of equiatomic composition(Ag20Pd20Pt20Cu20Ni20-20 at. %) was studied as a potential high-performancematerial. The equiatomic composition was used so that this alloy could beclassified in the subgroup of high-entropy alloys (HEA). The alloy was preparedby induction melting at atmospheric pressure, using high purity elements. Thedegree of metastability of the cast state was estimated on the basis of changesin the microstructure during annealing at high temperatures in a protectiveatmosphere of argon. Characterisation of the metallographically prepared samples was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-raydiffraction (XRD). Observation shows that the microstructure of the CCNA is in a very metastable state and multiphase, consisting of a continuous base ofdendritic solidification-a matrix with an interdendritic region without othermicrostructural components and complex spheres. A model of the probable flow ofmetastable solidification of the studied alloy was proposed, based on theseparation of L-melts into L1 (rich in Ni) and L2 (rich in Ag). The phenomenon ofliquid phase separation in the considered CCNA is based on the monotecticreaction in the Ag-Ni system.

LID - 10.3390/ma15144774 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The present study evaluated the marginal gap of lithium disilicatecrowns fabricated through three different wax pattern techniques; Conventional,Milling and 3D-printing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty stone models werereplicated from a stainless-steel model representing a prepared tooth; ten weresent to make conventional wax patterns while the remaining were sent to a digitaldental scanner. The computer aided design was completed and STL (StandardTessellation Language) files were sent to either milling or 3D-printing machines.All wax patterns (n = 30) were pressed, and a stabilizing instrument was used to secure the crowns on the master model. The marginal gap was measured at 18 pointsfor each crown using a digital microscope (microm) (n = 540) and compared usingOne-way ANOVA (p </= 0.05). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in themarginal gap value between all three groups (p &lt; 0.01) where the milled group showed the least mean gap (28.87 +/- 30.18 microm), followed by 3D printed (47.85+/- 27.44 microm), while the highest mean marginal gap was found in theconventional group (63.49 +/- 28.05 microm). CONCLUSION: Milled and 3D-printedwax patterns produced better fitting crowns compared to conventional techniques.

AB  - The railway wheel is the key component of high-speed railway train. To assure thesafety in service, higher requirements are put forward in this study for thecomposition, microstructure uniformity, and comprehensive properties of wheelmaterials. In this paper, the high throughput quantitative distributioncharacterization methods of composition, microstructure, inclusions and Vickershardness of high-speed railway wheel materials based on the spark source originalposition analysis technique, high throughput scanning electron microscope (SEM)combined with image batch processing technology, and automatic two-dimensionalquantitative distribution analysis technique of inclusions and micro hardnesshave been studied. The distribution trend of the content of nine elements, sizeand quantity of sulfides and oxides, ferrite area fraction, and Vickers hardness from the wheel tread surface to the radial depth of about 50 mm below the surfacehas been discussed. The influence of inclusions distribution on the elementsegregation and the effect of rim-chilling process with different water spraying angle on the distribution of microstructure and micro hardness have beeninvestigated. It was found that unsynchronized cooling on both sides of the rimaltered the phase behavior of ferrite and pearlite and obvious inhomogeneitydistribution of ferrite appeared, which led to the asymmetrical Vickers hardness in areas near or away from the flange. Based on the quantitative characterizationof area fraction and micro hardness on the same location of wheel rim, astatistical mapping relationship between ferrite area fraction and Vickershardness was established.

TI  - Effect of Surface Topology on the Apparent Thermal Diffusivity of Thin Samples atLFA Measurements.
LID - 4755 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15144755 [doi]
AB  - This paper deals with the problem of the influence of surface topography on theresults of thermal diffusivity measurements when determined using theinstantaneous surface heat source method, also called the pulse method. Theanalysis was based on numerical tests carried out using Comsol Multiphysicssoftware. The results of experimental investigations on the actual materialstructure using an electron microscope, an optical microscope and a profilometer were used to develop a numerical model. The influence of the non-uniformity ofthe surface of the tested sample on the determined values of half-time of thethermal response of the sample's rough surface to the impulse forcing on theopposing flat surface was determined by developing the data for simulatedmeasurements. The effect of the position of the response data reading area on theobtained simulation results was also analyzed. The obtained results can be usedto improve the accuracy of experimental heat transfer studies performed onthin-film engineering structures depending on the uniformity and parallelism ofthe material applied to engineering structures. The difference in half-lifedetermination error results for various analyzed models can be as high as 16.7%, depending on the surface from which the responses of the heating impulse areread. With an equivalent model in which 10% of the material volume corresponds tothe rough part as a single inclusion, hemisphere, the error in determiningthermal diffusivity was equal to 3.8%. An increase in the number of inclusionswith smaller weight reduces an error in the determination of thermal diffusivity,as presented in the paper.

TI  - Transcriptional Regulation and Protein Localization of Zip10, Zip13 and Zip14Transporters of Freshwater Teleost Yellow Catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidracoFollowing Zn Exposure in a Heterologous HEK293T Model.

AB  - Zip family proteins are involved in the control of zinc (Zn) ion homeostasis. Thepresent study cloned the promoters and investigated the transcription responsesand protein subcellular localizations of three LIV-1 subfamily members (zip10,zip13, and zip14) from common freshwater teleost yellow catfish, Pelteobagrusfulvidraco, using in vitro cultured HEK293T model cells. The 2278 bp, 1917 bp,and 1989 bp sequences of zip10, zip13, and zip14 promoters, respectively, weresubcloned into pGL3-Basic plasmid for promoter activity analysis. The pcDNA3.1plasmid coding EGFP tagged pfZip10, pfZip13, and pfZip14 were generated forsubsequent confocal microscope analysis. Several potential transcription factors'binding sites were predicted within the promoters. In vitro promoter analysis in the HEK293T cells showed that high Zn administration significantly reduced thetranscriptional activities of the zip10, zip13, and zip14 promoters. The -2017bp/-2004 bp MRE in the zip10 promoter, the -360 bp/-345 bp MRE in the zip13promoter, and the -1457 bp/-1442 bp MRE in the zip14 promoter were functionalloci that were involved in the regulation of the three zips. The -606 bp/-594 bp KLF4 binding site in the zip13 promoter was a functional locus responsible forzinc-responsive regulation of zip13. The -1383 bp/-1375 bp STAT3 binding site in the zip14 promoter was a functional locus responsible for zinc-responsiveregulation of zip14. Moreover, confocal microscope analysis indicated that zincincubation significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity of pfZip10-EGFP andpfZip14-EGFP but had no significant influence on pfZip13-EGFP fluorescenceintensity. Further investigation found that pfZip10 localizes on cell membranes, pfZip14 colocalized with both cell membranes and lysosome, and pfZip13colocalized with intracellular ER and Golgi. Our research illustrated thetranscription regulation of zip10, zip13, and zip14 from P. fulvidraco under zincadministration, which provided a reference value for the mechanisms involved inZip-family-mediated control of zinc homeostasis in vertebrates.

LID - 7999 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147999 [doi]
AB  - This work focuses on formulating liposomes to be used in isolated kidney dynamic machine perfusion in hypothermic conditions as drug delivery systems to improvepreservation of transplantable organs. The need mainly arises from use of kidneysfrom marginal donors for transplantation that are more exposed toischemic/reperfusion injury compared to those from standard donors. Two liposome preparation techniques, thin film hydration and microfluidic techniques, areexplored for formulating liposomes loaded with two model proteins, myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. The protein-loaded liposomes are characterized for theirsize by DLS and morphology by TEM. Protein releases from the liposomes are testedin PERF-GEN perfusion fluid, 4 degrees C, and compared to the in vitro proteinrelease in PBS, 37 degrees C. Fluorescent liposome uptake is analyzed byfluorescent microscope in vitro on epithelial tubular renal cell cultures and ex vivo on isolated pig kidney in hypothermic perfusion conditions. The results showthat microfluidics are a superior technique for obtaining reproducible spherical liposomes with suitable size below 200 nm. Protein encapsulation efficiency isaffected by its molecular weight and isoelectric point. Lowering incubationtemperature slows down the proteins release; the perfusion fluid significantlyaffects the release of proteins sensitive to ionic media (such as BSA). Liposomesare taken up by epithelial tubular renal cells in two hours' incubation time.

TI  - Cysteamine-Gold Coated Carboxylated Fluorescent Nanoparticle MediatedPoint-of-Care Dual-Modality Detection of the H5N1 Pathogenic Virus.
LID - 7957 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147957 [doi]
AB  - Globally, point-of-care testing (POCT) is the most preferable on-site techniquefor disease detection and includes a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT). The testing kits are generallyinsufficient in terms of signal enhancement, which is a major drawback of thisapproach. Sensitive and timely on-site POCT methods with high signal enhancement are therefore essential for the accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases.Herein, we prepare cysteamine-gold coated carboxylated europium chelatednanoparticle (Cys Au-EuNPs)-mediated POCT for the detection of the H5N1 avianinfluenza virus (AIV). Commercial nanoparticles were used for comparison. Thespectral characteristics, surface morphologies, functional groups, surface chargeand stability of the Cys AuNPs, EuNPs, and Cys Au-EuNPs were confirmed byUV-visible spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, transmission electronmicroscope with Selected area electron diffraction (TEM-SAED), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and zeta potential analysis. The particle sizedistribution revealed an average size of ~130 +/- 0.66 nm for the Cys Au-EuNPs.The Cys Au-EuNP-mediated RDT (colorimetric analysis) and FICT kit revealed alimit of detection (LOD) of 10 HAU/mL and 2.5 HAU/mL, respectively, for H5N1under different titer conditions. The obtained LOD is eight-fold that ofcommercial nanoparticle conjugates. The photo luminance (PL) stability of ~3% theCys Au-EuNPs conjugates that was obtained under UV light irradiation differsconsiderably from that of the commercial nanoparticle conjugates. Overall, thedeveloped Cys Au-EuNPs-mediated dual-mode POCT kit can be used as an effectivenanocomposite for the development of on-site monitoring systems for infectiousdisease surveillance.

AB  - The magnetic biochar material CoFe2O4/PCPS (peanut shell powder) was preparedbased on the hybrid calcination method. The properties of prepared composites andthe extraction effect of magnetic solid phase extraction on phenoxy carboxylicacid herbicides were assessed. The morphology, crystal structure, specificsurface area, and pore size distribution of the material were analysed using atransmission electron microscope (TEM), infrared Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS), and N2 absorption surface analysis (BET). The results of the magnetic solid phase extraction of a variety of phenoxy carboxylic acidherbicides in water using CoFe2O4/PCPS composites showed that, when the massratio of CoFe2O4 and PCPS was 1:1, 40 mg of the composite was used, and theadsorption time was 10 min at pH 8.50. Methanol was used as the eluent, and therecovery rates of the three phenoxy carboxylic acid herbicides were maintained at81.95-99.07%. Furthermore, the actual water sample analysis results showed thatthe established method had good accuracy, stability, and reliability.

AB  - Although the clinical assessment of enamel thickness is important, hardly anytools exist for accurate measurements. The purpose of this study was to verifythe precision of enamel thickness measurements using swept-source opticalcoherence tomography (SS-OCT). Human extracted maxillary central and lateralincisors were used as specimens. Twenty-eight sites were measured in eachspecimen. The optical path length (OPL) at each measurement site was measured on the OCT images, and enamel thickness (e1) was calculated by dividing OPL by themean refractive index of enamel, 1.63. The specimens were then sectioned, and alight microscope was used to measure enamel thickness (e2). e1 and e2 were thencompared. Measurement errors between e1 and e2 for the central and lateralincisors were 0.04 (0.02; 0.06) mm and 0.04 (0.02; 0.07) mm [median value: (25%, 75% percentile)], respectively. No significant differences between measurementsites were noted for measurement errors between e1 and e2. These resultsdemonstrate that OCT can be used for noninvasive, accurate measurements of enamelthickness.

TI  - Virtual Pathology Education in Medical Schools Worldwide during the COVID-19Pandemic: Advantages, Challenges Faced, and Perspectives.
LID - 1578 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071578 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic shifted pathology education in medical schools worldwidetowards online delivery. To achieve this goal, various innovative platforms were used by pathology educators and medical students, facilitating both synchronousand asynchronous learning. The aim of this study was to review the publishedevidence regarding remote pathology teaching at the medical school level duringthis period, present our own experience, and provide some perspectives regarding the best mode of pathology teaching post-pandemic. Among its advantages, virtual pathology education was considered among students and educators as convenient,flexible, and engaging, while learning outcomes were met and students' academicperformance was in general satisfactory. However, several challenges were faced. For instance, suboptimal internet connection compromised the flow of classes and was even associated with a lower academic performance. The lack of hands-onlaboratory activities, such as operating the light microscope and tissuegrossing, and the reduced student interactions among themselves and theirinstructors, were also pointed out as significant drawbacks of remote pathologyeducation. Whereas online education has multiple advantages, experiencing thephysical university environment, in-person interactions and teamwork, exposure tothe "hidden curriculum", and hands-on activities are vital for medical schooleducation and future student development. In conclusion, the implementation of a blended approach in pathology education-where online and face-to-face sessionsare jointly used to promote students' engagement, interaction with theirinstructors and peers, and learning-could be the most optimal approach topathology teaching in medical schools post-pandemic.

TI  - Enhancement of Osteoblast Function through Extracellular Vesicles Derived fromAdipose-Derived Stem Cells.
LID - 1752 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071752 [doi]
AB  - Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a type of mesenchymal stem cell that isinvestigated in bone tissue engineering (BTE). Osteoblasts are the main cellsresponsible for bone formation in vivo and directing ADSCs to form osteoblaststhrough osteogenesis is a research topic in BTE. In addition to the osteogenesis of ADSCs into osteoblasts, the crosstalk of ADSCs with osteoblasts through thesecretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) may also contribute to bone formationin ADSC-based BTE. We investigated the effect of ADSC-secreted EVs (ADSC-EVs) on osteoblast function. ADSC-EVs (size </= 1000 nm) were isolated from the culturesupernatant of ADSCs through ultracentrifugation. The ADSC-EVs were observed tobe spherical under a transmission electron microscope. The ADSC-EVs were positivefor CD9, CD81, and Alix, but beta-actin was not detected. ADSC-EV treatment didnot change survival but did increase osteoblast proliferation and activity. The48 most abundant known microRNAs (miRNAs) identified within the ADSC-EVs wereselected and then subjected to gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The GO analysis revealed that these miRNAs arehighly relevant to skeletal system morphogenesis and bone development. The KEGGanalysis indicated that these miRNAs may regulate osteoblast function throughautophagy or the mitogen-activated protein kinase or Ras-related protein 1signaling pathway. These results suggest that ADSC-EVs enhance osteoblastfunction and can contribute to bone regeneration in ADSC-based BTE.

LID - 10.3390/bios12070499 [doi]
AB  - Gastroenteritis, as one of the main worldwide health challenges, especially inchildren, leads to 3-6 million deaths annually and causes nearly 20% of the totaldeaths of children aged <5 years, of which ~1.5 million gastroenteritis deathsoccur in developing nations. Viruses are the main causative agent (~70%) ofgastroenteritis episodes and their specific and early diagnosis via laboratoryassays is very helpful for having successful antiviral therapy and reduction ininfection burden. Regarding this importance, the present literature is the first review of updated improvements in the employing of different types of biosensors such as electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric for sensitive, simple, cheap,rapid, and specific diagnosis of human gastroenteritis viruses. The Introduction section is a general discussion about the importance of viral gastroenteritis,types of viruses that cause gastroenteritis, and reasons for the combination ofconventional diagnostic tests with biosensors for fast detection of virusesassociated with gastroenteritis. Following the current laboratory detection testsfor human gastroenteritis viruses and their limitations (with subsections:Electron Microscope (EM), Cell Culture, Immunoassay, and Molecular Techniques),structural features and significant aspects of various biosensing methods arediscussed in the Biosensor section. In the next sections, basic information onviruses causing gastroenteritis and recent developments for fabrication andtesting of different biosensors for each virus detection are covered, and theprospect of future developments in designing different biosensing platforms forgastroenteritis virus detection is discussed in the Conclusion and FutureDirections section as well.

TI  - Living Sample Viability Measurement Methods from Traditional Assays toNanomotion.
LID - 453 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070453 [doi]
AB  - Living sample viability measurement is an extremely common process in medical,pharmaceutical, and biological fields, especially drug pharmacology andtoxicology detection. Nowadays, there are a number of chemical, optical, andmechanical methods that have been developed in response to the growing demand forsimple, rapid, accurate, and reliable real-time living sample viabilityassessment. In parallel, the development trend of viability measurement methods(VMMs) has increasingly shifted from traditional assays towards the innovativeatomic force microscope (AFM) oscillating sensor method (referred to asnanomotion), which takes advantage of the adhesion of living samples to anoscillating surface. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the commonVMMs, laying emphasis on their benefits and drawbacks, as well as evaluating the potential utility of VMMs. In addition, we discuss the nanomotion technique,focusing on its applications, sample attachment protocols, and result displaymethods. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives on nanomotion arecommented on, mainly emphasizing scientific restrictions and developmentorientations.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a common infectious disease caused by Mycobacteriumtuberculosis, which usually disturbs the lungs, and remains the second leadingcause of death from an infectious disease worldwide after the humanimmunodeficiency virus. Herein, we constructed a simple and sensitive method for Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific DNA detection with the dark-field microscopicimaging of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) counting strategy and rolling-circleamplification (RCA). Taking advantage of RCA amplification, one target moleculeproduced hundreds of general oligonucleotides, which could form the sandwichstructure with capture-strand-modified magnetic beads and AuNPs. After magneticseparation, AuNPs were released and detected by dark-field imaging; about 10 fMMycobacterium tuberculosis-specific DNA target can still be differentiated fromthe blank. No significant change of the absorbance signals was observed when the target DNA to genomic DNA ratio (in mass) was from 1:0 to 1:10(6). The spikerecovery results in genomic DNA from human and Klebsiella pneumoniae suggestedthat the proposed method has the feasibility for application with biologicalsamples. This proposed method is performed on an entry-level dark-fieldmicroscope setup with only a 6 muL detection volume, which creates a new, simple,sensitive, and valuable tool for pathogen detection.

TI  - Salidroside Ameliorates Radiation Damage by Reducing Mitochondrial OxidativeStress in the Submandibular Gland.
LID - 1414 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071414 [doi]
AB  - Radiotherapy for patients with head and neck cancer inevitably causes radiationdamage to salivary glands (SGs). Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to mitochondrial damage and is critical in the pathophysiology of SGradiation damage. However, mitochondrial-targeted treatment is unavailable.Herein, both in vitro and in vivo models of radiation-damaged rat submandibularglands (SMGs) were used to investigate the potential role of salidroside inprotecting irradiated SGs. Cell morphology was observed with an invertedphase-contrast microscope. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD),catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membranepotential (MMP), and ATP were measured using relevant kits. The mitochondrialultrastructure was observed under transmission electron microscopy. Cellapoptosis was determined by Western blot and TUNEL assays. Saliva was measuredfrom Wharton's duct. We found that salidroside protected SMG cells and tissuesagainst radiation and improved the secretion function. Moreover, salidrosideenhanced the antioxidant defense by decreasing MDA, increasing SOD, CAT, and GSH,and scavenging mitochondrial ROS. Furthermore, salidroside rescued themitochondrial ultrastructure, preserved MMP and ATP, suppressed cytosoliccytochrome c and cleaved caspase 3 expression, and inhibited cell apoptosis.Together, these findings first identify salidroside as a mitochondrial-targetedantioxidant for preventing SG radiation damage.

AB  - (1) Background: With unknown causes and no effective treatment available,Alzheimer's disease (AD) places enormous pressure on families and society. Ourprevious study had shown that Ebselen at a high concentration (10.94 muM)improved the cognition of triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice and alleviated the related pathological indicators but showed toxicity to the mice. Here, wededicated to study the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of Ebselen at amuch lower concentration on 3xTg-AD mice. (2) Methods: Various behavioralexperiments were applied to detect the behavioral ability of mice. Western blot, thioflavin T staining and a transmission electron microscope were used toevaluate the pathology of AD mice. The mitochondrial membrane potential andrespiration were assessed with the corresponding assay kit. (3) Results: Ebselen remarkably increased cognitive ability of AD mice, eliminated beta-Amyloid(Abeta) oligomers and recovered the synaptic damage in AD mice brain. Inaddition, the destroyed mitochondrial morphologies and function were repaired by Ebselen through ameliorating mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrialbiogenesis and mitochondrial fusion/fission balance in N2a-SW cells and braintissues of AD mice. (4) Conclusions: This research indicated that Ebselen mightexert its therapeutic effect via protecting mitochondria in AD.

TI  - Oxidative Stress Can Be Attenuated by 4-PBA Caused by High-Fat or AmmoniaNitrogen in Cultured Spotted Seabass: The Mechanism Is Related to EndoplasmicReticulum Stress.
LID - 1276 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071276 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress is a common phenomenon in aquaculture, which can be induced bynutritional or environmental factors. Generally, oxidative stress causes poorgrowth performance, metabolic dysregulation, and even the death of aquaticanimals. To identify a nutritional intervention strategy, high-fat diet (HFD)feeding (Experiment I) and acute ammonia nitrogen challenge (Experiment II) testswere carried out. In Experiment I, HFD feeding significantly decreased the growthperformance concomitantly with excessive fat deposition in the liver and abdomen.The addition of 4-PBA in the diet improved the excessive fat accumulation. Theactivities of antioxidative enzymes were suppressed, and the levels of lipid and protein peroxidation were increased, indicating that HFD feeding inducedoxidative stress. The endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs) related genes weredownregulated in the HFD group. Under a transmission electron microscope (TEM),more swollen and dilated ER lumen could be observed. These results indicated thatthe HFD induced ERs activation. Although 4-PBA acted as a potent ERs inhibitor,as evidenced by the alleviated alterations of ERs molecules and the ERultrastructure, the oxidative stress was also attenuated by 4-PBA. In Experiment II, dietary 4-PBA improved the tolerance to the acute ammonia nitrogen challenge,as lower mortality and serum aminotransferase activity was found. Further resultsshowed that 4-PBA decreased the peroxidation content and attenuated ERs, thusconfirming the correlation between oxidative stress and ERs. Our findings showed that dietary 4-PBA supplementation can attenuate oxidative stress induced by aHFD or acute ammonia challenge; the mechanism is related to its potent inhibitioneffect for ERs.

TI  - MiR-152-5p suppresses osteogenic differentiation of mandible mesenchymal stemcells by regulating ATG14-mediated autophagy.
PG  - 359
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03018-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis affects the mandible resulting in bone loss. Thoughimpairments are not life threatening, they affect a person's quality-of-lifeparticularly vulnerable elderly. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are novel regulatory factors that play an important role in regulating bone metabolism. Autophagy isevolutionarily conserved intracellular self-degradation process and is vital inthe maintenance of both miRNA and bone homeostasis. However, the role ofautophagy in the pathogenesis of miRNA regulating osteoporosis remains unclear.METHODS: In the study, we established a rat osteoporosis model induced byovariectomy (OVX) and isolated mesenchymal stem cells from mandible (MMSCs-M).Several miRNAs were identified to regulate osteoporosis in some studies. qRT-PCR was applied to examine the expression of miRNA, autophagy and osteogenicdifferentiation-related genes. Western blotting assays were performed to detectthe expression of autophagy and osteogenic differentiation proteins.Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscope were used to verify theautophagy activity. Transfecting technology was used to enhance or suppress theexpression of miR-152-5p which enable us to observe the relationship betweenmiR-152-5p, autophagy and osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, themeasurement of reactive oxygen species was used to investigate the mechanism ofautophagy affecting osteogenic differentiation. RESULTS: We found an upregulated expression of miR-152-5p in MMSCs-M in OVX group. Downregulated autophagy-relatedgene, proteins and autophagosome were detected in vitro of OVX group comparedwith sham group. Moreover, downregulation of miR-152-5p promoted osteogenicdifferentiation of MMSCs-M as well as enhanced autophagy-related proteins in OVX group. Conversely, overexpression of miR-152-5p showed opposite effect in shamgroup. Meanwhile, we found Atg14 (autophagy-related protein homolog 14) wasidentified to be a direct target of miR-152-5p theoretically and functionally. Inother words, we confirmed inhibition of miR-152-5p promoted the osteogenicdifferentiation via promoting ATG14-mediated autophagy. Furthermore,miR-152-5p/ATG14-mediated autophagy regulated osteogenic differentiation byreducing the endogenous ROS accumulation and maintaining cellular redoxhomeostasis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that miR-152-5p is the first identifiedto regulate osteogenic differentiation by directly targeting autophagy-relatedprotein ATG14 and regulating oxidative stress and therapeutic inhibition ofmiR-152-5p may be an efficient anabolic strategy for osteoporosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) oncogene is required for the survival ofdiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is incurable using conventionalchemotherapy. Thus, it is imperative to improve the survival of patients withDLBCL. Disulfide (DSF) has been shown to have anticancer effects, but its effect on DLBCL remains unclear. METHODS: Four DLBCL cell lines (OCI-LY1, OCI-LY7,OCI-LY10 and U2932) and primary DLBCL cells from eight newly diagnosed DLBCLpatients were pretreated with DSF alone or in combination with Cu. Cellmorphology was observed under microscope. Flow cytometry was performed toevaluate the cell apoptosis, cell cycle, the mitochondrial membrane potential andthe intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The proteinexpression was respectively measured by flow cytometry and western blotting.RESULTS: DSF or DSF/Cu exhibited a marked inhibitory effect on the growth ofDLBCL cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Meanwhile, DSF or DSF/Cu significantly induced DLBCL cells apoptosis. Further study revealedthat DSF or DSF/Cu promoted apoptosis by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Interestingly, DSF/Cu significantly reduced BCL6 and AIP levels. In addition, DSFsignificantly up-regulate p53 protein in OCI-LY7 and OCI-LY10 while down-regulatep53 protein in OCI-LY1 and U2932. CONCLUSION: These results provided evidence forthe anti-lymphoma effects of DSF on DLBCL and suggested that DSF has therapeutic potential to DLBCL.

AB  - Total holographic characterization (THC) is presented here as an efficient,automated, label-free method of accurately identifying cell viability. THC is asingle-particle characterization technology that determines the size and index ofrefraction of individual particles using the Lorenz-Mie theory of lightscattering. Although assessment of cell viability is a challenge in manyapplications, including biologics manufacturing, traditional approaches ofteninclude unreliable labeling with dyes and/or time consuming methods of manuallycounting cells. In this work we measured the viability of Saccharomycescerevisiae yeast in the presence of various concentrations of isopropanol as afunction of time. All THC measurements were performed in the native environmentof the sample with no dilution or addition of labels. Holographic measurementswere made with an in-line holographic microscope using a 40[Formula: see text]objective lens with plane wave illumination. We compared our results with THC to manual counting of living and dead cells as distinguished with trypan blue dye.Our findings demonstrate that THC can effectively distinguish living and deadyeast cells by the index of refraction of individual cells.

AB  - There is growing interest in 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), an active thyroid hormone metabolite, that induces negative inotropic and chronotropic actions in the heartand exerts systemic hypothermic action. We explored the direct impact of T1AM on cardiomyocytes with a focus on the regulation of the intracellular temperatureand natriuretic peptide (NP) expression. A thermoprobe was successfullyintroduced into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and the temperature-dependentchanges in the fluorescence intensity ratio were measured using a fluorescencemicroscope. After one-hour incubation with T1AM, the degree of change in thefluorescence intensity ratio was significantly lower in T1AM-treatedcardiomyocytes than in equivalent solvent-treated controls (P < 0.01), indicatingthe direct hypothermic action of T1AM on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, T1AMtreatment upregulated B-type NP (BNP) gene expression comparable to treatmentwith endothelin-1 or phenylephrine. Of note, ERK phosphorylation was markedlyincreased after T1AM treatment, and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by an MEKinhibitor completely cancelled both T1AM-induced decrease in thermoprobe-measuredtemperature and the increase in BNP expression. In summary, T1AM decreasesfluorescent thermoprobe-measured temperatures (estimated intracellulartemperatures) and increases BNP expression in cardiomyocytes by activating theMEK/ERK pathway. The present findings provide new insight into the directmyocardial cellular actions of T1AM in patients with severe heart failure.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16777-0 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we report the design and synthesis of internal energy-driven Janus nanomotors (JNMs), which are composed of certain reactive materials that arecapable of converting chemical energy in the backbone of nanomotors into kinetic energy. For this purpose, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)with the anisotropic surface were obtained via a Pickering emulsion. Modifiedchitosan (as hydrophilic polymer) and functionalized polycaprolactone (ashydrophobic domain) were covalently linked to the surface of bi-functional SPIONsto produce Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). Then, the CALB enzyme was loaded in thePCL hemisphere of JNPs to form the Janus nanomotor. When nanomotors are placed inthe phosphate-buffered saline solution, the driving force for motion is provided by the decomposition of polyester into monomers and oligomers on one side of the JNMs. The trajectories of the nanomotors were recorded under differentcircumstances by a video microscope and analyzed by the mean squareddisplacement. The results show that the velocity of JNMs increases with anincreasing percentage of the loaded enzyme. In addition, the diffusioncoefficient enhances up to 87.67% in compared with nanoparticles without enzyme. Controlling the motion direction of JNMs by an external magnetic field is alsopossible, due to the presence of SPIONs.

TI  - Selective Visualization of Live Intestinal Parasites in Stool Specimens WithoutPurification.
LID - 10.1007/s11686-022-00590-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Microscopic observation of live parasites in the stool is an importantdiagnostic tool in human and veterinary medicine. Because of the presence oflarge amounts of contaminating organic matter, microscopic analysis must bepreceded by time-consuming pre-purification steps. Transmission-through-dye (TTD)optical microscopy obviates this problem. The purpose of this study is toillustrate the use of TTD for the analysis of stool samples. METHODS: TTD imagingis based on the exclusion of a strongly absorbing dye by living cells. A foodcolorant Acid Blue 9 (AB9) is added to a fecal suspension, and the sample isobserved under transmitted illumination through a 630 nm bandpass filter. AB9strongly absorbs red light, and it comes out of the sample significantlyattenuated. However, if a viable cell of any origin is present in the sample, it excludes the dye and reduces the depth of the light-absorbing layer. RESULTS:Live cells or eggs appear bright red on a dark background, while most of theorganic contaminants remain dark. The method has been demonstrated onschistosomes, hookworms, giardia, yeast, and other organisms. CONCLUSION: TTDdramatically increases the visibility of live parasites and permits their direct observation in a fecal suspension. TTD can be enabled on any microscope by simplyadding a red filter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corneal and lenticular optical properties are not well-documented in pediatric patients with inflammatory diseases. Here we aimed to evaluate corneal and lenticular optical density as well as corneal morphology in children withocular and/or systemic inflammation by Scheimpflug imaging. METHODS: Fifty-fiveeyes of 29 children with non-infectious uveitis, 56 eyes of 28 children withsystemic inflammation without uveitis and 60 eyes of 31 healthy children wereincluded. Corneal/lenticular optical density, corneal volume, central cornealthickness, keratometry were analyzed by Pentacam HR. Corneal endothelial celldensity, hexagonal cell ratio and coefficient of variation were measured byspecular microscope. RESULTS: The mean age was 12.0+/-3.1 years, 11.9+/-4.0 yearsand 11.3+/-3.4 years whereas the female/ratio was 15/14, 15/13 and 14/17 inuveitis, systemic inflammation and control groups respectively. Uveitis type was anterior uveitis in 16 (29.1%) eyes, intermediate uveitis in 32 (58.2%) eyes and panuveitis in 7 (12.7%) eyes. Twenty-two (40%) eyes had active uveitis whereas 33(60%) eyes had inactive uveitis. Corneal optical density was greater in uveitisgroup compared with other groups (p=0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Lenticulardensity and corneal parameters other than optical density were not differentbetween the groups (p>0.05). Corneal optical density was higher in active uveitisthan inactive uveitis (22/33 eyes, p=0.017). CONCLUSION: Children with uveitishad decreased corneal clarity compared with systemic inflammation group andhealthy controls, while lenticular clarity was similar between the groups.Corneal endothelial parameters did not change significantly based onocular/systemic inflammation. Scheimpflug imaging provides objective corneal and lenticular optical density measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-resistant bacteria, a result of the abuse of antibiotics, have greatly frustrated the effectiveness of antibiotics and produced a variety ofside-effects. The combination of antibiotics with other therapies likeantimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may provide a useful strategy forfighting resistant bacteria. Here, the synergistic bactericidal effects oftoluidine blue (TB)-aPDT and gentamicin (GEN) were evaluated in vitro and invivo. METHODS: The Post-antibacterial effects were measured at 600 nm (OD600) by a microplate reader. The bacterial envelope and biofilm were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope. The expression of oxidative stress and Agrsystem-related genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR after GEN combined with TB-aPDT(GEN&aPDT). Besides, the burn infection model was established to investigate the cloning efficiency of immobilized bacteria, wound healing and inflammatoryfactors in the lesions. RESULTS: GEN&aPDT could inhibit the growth of S. aureusand multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDR S. aureus) for up to 15 h, and destroyedthe cell envelope and biofilm structure of S. aureus and MDR S. aureus. Duringthe process, ROS played an important role, inducing oxidative stress anddownregulating the expression of AgrA, AgrB and PSM in the Agr system, resulting in decreased bacterial virulence and infectivity. In addition, GEN&aPDTcotreatment could effectively promoted wound healing in burn-infected mice byreducing the numbers of bacterial colonization in the wound, decreasing thecontent of inflammatory factors, and increasing the expression of growth factors.CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed a bactericidal synergy between GEN andaPDT in vitro and in vivo, therein, the oxidative stress exhibited an importantrole in decreasing bacterial virulence and infectivity, which may bring new ideasfor the treatment of bacterial resistance.

TI  - Angle Examination Gonioscopy and Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgical Training onHuman Eyes in Wet Lab.
LID - 10.1097/IJG.0000000000002075 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To understand the feasibility, utility and efficacy of a low-cost model for performing anterior chamber angle gonioscopy and micro-surgery on humancorneo-scleral tissues in wet lab on resident skill enhancement. METHODS:Post-keratoplasty residual corneo-scleral rims and/or the expired donorcorneo-scleral buttons were included for the purpose of this study. Initially,inverted rims were used to demonstrate the basic angle anatomy on a slit lampbio-microscope. Central hazy cornea was then replaced with an artificial corneaand an artificial anterior chamber to simulate indirect gonioscopy, directgonioscopy, goniotomy and other angle-based surgeries. Direct gonioscopy andgoniotomy exercises (as a means to simulate intra-operative gonioscopy and other angle-based surgeries respectively) were evaluated quantitatively, and the restqualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 65 residents were included in the exercise.The mean age was 26.69+/-1.74 years. Amongst these, 55 ophthalmology residentsperformed the basic examination, that is, slit lamp mounted angle anatomyexamination (n=55) and artificial chamber mounted indirect gonioscopicexamination through artificial cornea (n=55). In the second exercise, 10 glaucomafellows performed the direct gonioscopic and the goniotomy exercises onartificial chamber. The fellows demonstrated a statistically significantimprovement in interpretation and surgical skill enhancement concurrent withreduction in time taken with increasing number of attempts (P<0.05). In the thirdsimulation exercise, micro-stent placement within the Schlemm's canal,sub-conjunctival space, and the supra-choroidal space was re-producedsuccessfully on multiple occasions. CONCLUSIONS: The residual humancorneo-scleral rims proved to be an important resource for teaching both thebasic examination skills as well as those required for transitioning to advanced intraoperative gonioscopy and goniotomy skills. These low cost, easy to adaptmodels can be incorporated within the curriculum for improved glaucoma trainingof both the residents and the glaucoma fellows.

TI  - Puerarin alleviates LPS-induced H9C2 cell injury by inducing mitochondrialautophagy.
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000001315 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Sepsis leads to the damage of multiple organs, and thereby adverselyaffects the cardiovascular system. At present, no effective method has been foundto treat myocardial injury caused by sepsis. While Puerarin was reported toattenuate LPS-induced mitochondrial injury in HUVECs, the effects of Puerarin in sepsis-induced myocardial injury remain unclear. In this study, H9C2 cells werestimulated with LPS, CCK-8 assays were performed to assess cell viability, andflow cytometry and TUNEL staining were used to assess cell apoptosis. Levels ofATP, ADP, AMP and enzyme activity were investigated using commercial kits. ROSlevels in H9C2 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Autophagosomes in themitochondria of H9C2 cells were observed by transmission electron microscope(TEM), and protein expression was assessed by western blotting. We found thatPuerarin significantly reversed LPS-induced decreases in H9C2 cell viability byinhibiting apoptosis. The ROS levels in H9C2 cells were significantly upregulatedby LPS, but that effect was markedly reduced by Puerarin. In addition, Puerarinattenuated LPS-induced mitochondrial injury in H9C2 cells by regulatingdynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). LPS decreased enzymeactivity and reduced the levels of ADP, ALP, and AMP in mitochondria; however,those effects were reversed by Puerarin. Puerarin and Torin1 reversed LPS-inducedinhibition of autophagy in the mitochondria of H9C2 cells via mediation of p62,LC3B, Pink1, and Parkin. Puerarin inhibited LPS-induced H9C2 cell injury byinducing mitochondrial autophagy, which acts as a mechanism for preventingmyocardial injury caused by sepsis.

TI  - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy in a Scanning Electron Microscope forthe High-Throughput Imaging of Biological Assemblies.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00323 [doi]
AB  - Electron microscopy of soft and biological materials, or "soft electronmicroscopy", is essential to the characterization of macromolecules. Softmicroscopy is governed by enhancing contrast while maintaining low electrondoses, and sample preparation and imaging methodologies are driven by the length scale of features of interest. While cryo-electron microscopy offers the highest resolution, larger structures can be characterized efficiently and with highcontrast using low-voltage electron microscopy by performing scanningtransmission electron microscopy in a scanning electron microscope (STEM-in-SEM).Here, STEM-in-SEM is demonstrated for a four-lobed protein assembly where thearrangement of the proteins in the construct must be examined. STEM imagesimulations show the theoretical contrast enhancement at SEM-level voltages forunstained structures, and experimental images with multiple STEM modes exhibitthe resolution possible for negative-stained proteins. This technique can beextended to complex protein assemblies, larger structures such as cell sections, and hybrid materials, making STEM-in-SEM a valuable high-throughput imagingmethod.

TI  - Environmental Impacts of Ecofriendly Iron Oxide Nanoparticles on Dyes Removal andAntibacterial Activity.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04105-1 [doi]
AB  - Biosynthesized nanoparticles have a promising future since they are a moreenvironmentally friendly, cost-effective, repeatable, and energy-efficienttechnique than physical or chemical synthesis. In this work, Purpureocilliumlilacinum was used to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3-NPs).Characterization of mycosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs was done by using UV-visspectroscopy, transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering(DLS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. UV-vis gave characteristic surfaceplasmon resonance (SPR) peak for Fe2O3-NPs at 380 nm. TEM image reveals that the morphology of biosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs was hexagonal, and their size rangebetween 13.13 and 24.93 nm. From the XRD analysis, it was confirmed thecrystalline nature of Fe2O3 with average size 57.9 nm. Further comparative study of photocatalytic decolorization of navy blue (NB) and safranin (S) usingFe2O3-NPs was done. Fe2O3-NPs exhibited potential catalytic activity with areduction of 49.3% and 66% of navy blue and safranin, respectively. Further, the antimicrobial activity of Fe2O3-NPs was analyzed against pathogenic bacteria(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus). The Fe2O3-NPs were clearly more effective on gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and B. subtilis) than gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). Thus, the mycosynthesized Fe2O3-NPs exhibited an ecofriendly, sustainable, andeffective route for decolorization of navy blue and safranin dyes andantibacterial activity.

TI  - Taking molecular pathology to the next level: Whole slide multicolor confocalimaging with the Pannoramic Confocal digital pathology scanner.
LID - 10.1002/cyto.a.24675 [doi]
AB  - The emergence and fast advance of digital pathology allows the acquisition,digital storage, interactive recall and analysis of morphology at the tissuelevel. When applying immunohistochemistry, it also affords the correlation ofmorphology with the expression of one or two specific molecule of interest. Therise of fluorescence pathology scanners expands the number of detected molecules based on multiplex labelling. The Pannoramic Confocal (created by 3DHistech,Hungary) is a first-of-the-kind digital pathology scanner that affords not onlymultiplexed fluorescent detection on top of conventional transmission imaging,but also confocality. We have benchmarked this scanner in terms of stability,precision, light efficiency, linearity and sensitivity. X-Y stability andrelocalisation precision were well below resolution limit (</=50 nm). Lightthroughput in confocal mode was 4-5 times higher than that of a point scanningconfocal microscope, yielding similar calculated confocal intensities but withthe potential for improving signal to noise ratio or scan speed. Response waslinear with R(2) >/=0.9996. Calibrated measurements showed that using indirectlabeling >/= 2000 molecules per cell could be well detected and imaged on thecell surface. Both standard-based and statistical post-acquisition flatfieldcorrections are implemented. We have also measured the point spread function(PSF) of the instrument. The dimensions of the PSF are somewhat larger and lesssymmetric than of the theoretical PSF of a conventional CLSM, however, thespatial homogeneity of these parameters allows for obtaining a specific systemPSF for each optical path and using it for optional on-the-fly deconvolution. In conclusion, the Pannoramic Confocal provides sensitive, quantitative widefieldand confocal detection of multiplexed fluorescence signals, with opticalsectioning and 3D reconstruction, in addition to brightfield transmissionimaging. High speed scanning of large samples, analysis of tissue heterogeneity, and detection of rare events open up new ways for quantitatively analyzing tissuesections, organoid cultures or large numbers of adherent cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine immunohistochemical features of IgG4-related disease inpatients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIAL AND METHODS:Immunohistochemical testing of colonic biopsy material from 35 patients with IBD (24 cases of ulcerative colitis and 11 cases of Crohn's disease) was carried out using IgG, IgG4 and CD138 antibodies. The number of IgG4- and CD138-positivecells was counted in high power field of microscope (x400). Patient selection wasrandom. RESULTS: IgG4-positive cells were detected in the colonic mucosa of 5patients with ulcerative colitis. The age of the patients ranged from 24 to 47years. Two patients had a total, and three had a left-sided lesion of the colon. The anamnesis of the disease ranged from 3 to 13 years. The number of positively stained cells in the reaction with the antibody to IgG4 varied from 2 to 50 inhigh power field of microscope. We were able to detect over 10 IgG4-positivecells in 3 females aged 28, 30 and 31 years with a long history of ulcerativecolitis (5, 4 and 3 years, respectively). Two patients had a total lesion of the colon, all three had an exacerbation of the disease, and a morphological studyrevealed chronic diffuse active erosive colitis. A high degree of histologicalactivity and pronounced diffuse basal plasmacytosis were noted. In one of thecases, the infiltrate captured the muscular lamina of the mucosa and areas of thesubmucosa. CONCLUSIONS: IgG4-positive cells in the inflammatory infiltrate,including those with an excess of more than 10 in the field of view of themicroscope at high magnification, can be observed in patients with ulcerativecolitis with severe and prolonged course of the disease. To classify this colitisas a manifestation of an IgG4-related disease, the results of immunohistochemicalstudies alone are not enough. It is required to accumulate a larger number ofobservations, as well as to search for other diagnostic criteria for anIgG4-related disease in these patients.

TI  - Evolution of the combined effect of different irrigation solutions and activationtechniques on the removal of smear layer and dentin microhardness in oval-shaped root canal - An in-vitro study.
LID - 10.17305/bjbms.2022.7440 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of three finalirrigants, namely QMix, MTAD and EDTA, combined with three irrigation techniques,namely conventional needle irrigation (CNI), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) and photon-induced photoacoustic streaming (PIPS), on smear layer removal, dentinmineral content and microhardness in oval-shaped canals. 130 decoronatedpremolars with single, oval root canals were equally divided into1 blank control group and 12 treatment groups (n=10) according to the final irrigation protocols.Roots in treatment groups were instrumented with ProTaper Gold to size F4 andsubjected to final irrigation. Smear layer removal was assessed by using afour-level scoring system under an environmental scanning electron microscope.Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was performed to measure the dentin mineral content. Dentin microhardness was measured by Knoop microhardness testing.Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using Kruskal-Wallis test,followed by Dunn's post hoc test with Bonferroni correction. PUI- andPIPS-activated QMix and EDTA removed smear layer more effectively than MTADgroups (p<0.05). Regarding the dentin mineral content and microhardness, QMixgroups yielded the least calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and Ca/P ratio, followed byEDTA groups and MTAD groups (p<0.05). QMix groups produced significantly lowerdentin microhardness values and higher hardness reduction percentages than MTADgroups (p<0.05). Within the limitations of the present study, it was concludedthat QMix and EDTA were superior to MTAD in smear layer removal, especially when activated by PUI and PIPS, but these agents produced more pronounced effect ondentin mineral content and microhardness than MTAD.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the 3Dexoscope in a microvascular anastomosis training setting and compare it with the gold-standard technique using the operating microscope (OM). Methods:Participants were recruited among otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery(OHNS) residents of two tertiary care hospitals. Trainees were asked to complete 4 microvascular end-to-end anastomoses on chicken thighs with the OM and VITOM 3Dexoscope. The performances were scored by experienced microvascular surgeons; an objective evaluation of the anastomosis and a subjective assessment of theworkload were conducted. Results: 8 OHNS residents were recruited. Consideringthe amount of time needed to complete (TTC) the anastomosis, an improvement wasshown by all the participants throughout the training program. The objectiveevaluation of the anastomosis did not show a significant difference. Nosignificant differences were found by analyzing the subjective workload with the different tools. Conclusions: This article represents the first attempt tocompare the use of the OM and the 3D exoscope during training for microsurgery.The results of our study demonstrate the noninferiority of microsurgical trainingobtained using the 3D exoscope compared to that offered by the OM.

AB  - Objective: To study the effects of exosome secreted by ovarian cancer (OC) cellon the differentiation and metastasis of normal fibroblasts (NFs). Methods: NFswere collected from patients who underwent hysteromyoma resection in theAffiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from May to December 2019. Exosome was extracted from the culture supernatant of SKOV3 cells by using ultra-high-speedcentrifugation. The NFs were co-cultured with condition medium (CM), exosome ofSKOV3 (SKOV3-exo) and control medium. The expression levels of fibroblastactivation protein (FAP) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and western blot. The metastatic ability of NFs was detected byTranswell array. Results: Under the transmission electron microscope, theextracellular vesicles extracted from the culture supernatant of SKOV3 were30-100 nm in diameter with cup holder-like bilayer membrane structure, and theprotein expression levels of TSG101 and HSP27 in exosomes (1.00+/-0.05 and1.12+/-0.13) were higher than those of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells (0.22+/-0.21and 0.36+/-0.14, respectively, P<0.05). PKH67 fluorescently labeled exosomescould be taken up by NFs. The expression levels of alpha-SMA and FAP mRNA in CMgroup(2.91+/-0.15 and 3.21+/-0.33)and SKOV3-exo group (3.50+/-0.21 and4.63+/-0.24, respectively) were higher than that in blank group (1.00+/-0.06 and 1.00+/-0.13, P<0.05). The protein expression levels of alpha-SMA and FAP in CMgroup and SKOV3-exo group (0.89+/-0.11 and 1.25+/-0.09, 0.81+/-0.09 and1.20+/-0.12) were higher than those in the blank group (0.12+/-0.31 and0.11+/-0.19, respectively, P<0.05). The migrated numbers of cells in the CM groupand SKOV3-exo group [(215.01+/-14.80) and (389.72+/-19.43), respectively] werehigher than that in the blank group [(113.73+/-4.70), P<0.05]. Conclusion: Theexosome secreted by SKOV3 cells can be taken up by NFs, which makes it todifferentiate into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and significantlyenhances its metastatic ability, indicating that OC cells may promote thetransformation of normal ovarian mesenchymal fibroblasts to CAFs through exosome pathways, and then promote the development of ovarian cancer.

PG  - 573-9
LID - 10.13702/j.1000-0607.20211346 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of pre-moxibustion at "Baihui"(GV20),"Shenshu"(BL23) and "Zusanli"(ST36) on expression of Tau protein and relatedprotein kinases as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), etc. in thehippocampal CA3 region of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats, so as to explore itsmechanism underlying prevention and treatment of AD cognitive impairment.METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control, shamoperation model and pre-moxibustionwith 9 rats in each group. Rats of thepre-moxibustion group received moxibustion of GV20, BL23 and ST36 for 15 min,once a day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks. After completion of moxibustion, the ADmodel was reproduced by injection of amyloid beta-peptide 25-35(Abeta 25-35)aggregation solution 1 muL (5 mug/muL) into the bilateral hippocampus, rats ofthe sham operation group received injection of the same dose of normal salineinto the hippocampus. The spatial learning-memory ability was detected usingMorris water maze test, and changes of the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons were observed using electron microscope, and those of histopathological changesof hippocampus tissue observed using hematoxylin eosin (H.E.) staining. Theexpression levels of hippocampal GSK-3beta, p-Tau, CDK5 and Synapsin I proteinswere detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Nosignificances were found between the normal control and sham groups in all theindexes (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, the escape latency of placenavigation test of Morris water maze test, expression of GSK-3beta and CDK5 andthe immunoactivity of GSK-3beta, CDK5 and p-Tau were significantly increased(P<0.01), and the residence time in the platform quadrant and the number ofplatform crossing of spatial prob test and the expression of Synapsinsignificantly reduced in the model group (P<0.01). Following the intervention,the increase of escape latency, expression of GSK-3beta and CDK5 and theimmunoactivity of GSK-3beta, CDK5 and p-Tau, and the decrease of residence timein the platform quadrant, number of platform crossing and the expression ofSynapsin were reversed in the pre-moxibustion group (P<0.05, P<0.01). Outcomes ofultrastructure and histopathological observations respectively showed edema ofhippocampal nerve cells at varying degrees, moderate edema of the cytoplasma,chromatin condensation at the edge of the nucleus, partial mitochondrialvacuole-like degeneration, fracture of tubular crest, edema and expansion ofGolgi body, disappearance of polarity, fracture of the rough endoplasmicreticulum, degeneration of ribosome and partial myelin axon and reduced synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic capsule; and reduced number of neurons with shrankbody, disappearance of nucleolus and blurred nuclear boundary and vacuole-likedegeneration in some of them in the model group, which were relatively milder in the pre-moxibustion group. CONCLUSION: Pre-moxibustion at GV20, BL23 and ST36plays a role in slowing down the occurrence and development of cognitiveimpairment in AD rats, which may be related to its functions in inhibiting tauprotein hyperphosphorylation and reducing the expression of some related protein kinases in the hippocampus.

AB  - We describe a modular computational framework for analyzing cell-widespatiotemporal signaling dynamics in single-cell microscopy experiments thataccounts for the experiment-specific geometric and diffractive complexities that arise from heterogeneous cell morphologies and optical instrumentation. Inputsare unique cell geometries and protein concentrations derived from confocalstacks and spatiotemporally varying environmental stimuli. After simulating thesystem with a model of choice, the output is convolved with the microscopepoint-spread function for direct comparison with the observable image. Weexperimentally validate this approach in single cells with BcLOV4, an optogeneticmembrane recruitment system for versatile control over cell signaling, using athree-dimensional non-linear finite element model with all parametersexperimentally derived. The simulations recapitulate observed subcellular andcell-to-cell variability in BcLOV4 signaling, allowing for inter-experimentaldifferences of cellular and instrumentation origins to be elucidated and resolvedfor improved interpretive robustness. This single-cell approach will enhanceoptogenetics and spatiotemporally resolved signaling studies.

LID - 10.1002/jemt.24200 [doi]
AB  - This article presents a review after an exhaustive search that yielded 23 workscarried out in the last decade for the availability of optical microscopes withopen hardware as a low-cost alternative to commercial systems. These works weredeveloped with the aim of covering needs within several areas such as: BioSciences research in institutions with limited resources, diagnosis of diseasesand health screenings in large populations in developing countries, and training in educational contexts with a need for high availability of equipment and lowreplacement cost. The analysis of the selected works allows us to classify theanalyzed solutions into two main categories, for which their essentialcharacteristics are enumerated: portable field microscopes and multipurposeautomated microscopes. Moreover, this work includes a discussion on the degree ofmaturity of the solutions in terms of the adoption of practices aligned with the development of Open Science.

TI  - Spinal cord compression in thoracolumbar burst fractures: application ofhigh-definition three-dimensional exoscope in minimally invasive lateral surgery.
LID - 10.1007/s00590-022-03319-7 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Spinal cord decompression in thoracolumbar burst fractures ischallenging. Development of minimally invasive approaches and the improvement in new magnification technologies allowed a better and safer surgical treatment for these complex spinal injuries. We reported our experience in the minimallyinvasive surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with spinal cordcompression supported by high-definition (HD) three-dimensional (3D)Video-assisted telescope operating monitor (VITOM) or exoscope. OBJECTIVES: Toassess the role and potential advantages of exoscope in the minimally invasivesurgery of traumatic thoracolumbar spinal cord compression comparing traditional magnification systems. SETTING: The study was conducted in a Northern ItalySpinal Trauma Center. METHODS: We reported 10 consecutive thoracolumbar (T11-L2) burst fractures associated with spinal cord compression treated with minimallyinvasive corpectomy and exoscope-assisted spinal decompression. Three mainindicators were retrospectively analyzed: surgical time, blood loss, andintraoperative complications. The data were compared with those obtained from an equal sample of 10 procedures performed by the same surgeon with the sametechnique, but traditional microscope assisted. User impressions in terms ofergonomics, magnification, and image quality were rated differently. RESULTS: Asmall reduction of surgical time and blood loss were observed in the exoscopeassisted group. There were no intraoperative complications attributed tovisualization mode or conversion to the traditional microscope in any procedure. In our experience the exoscope allowed a better magnification and imagedefinition with better ergonomics and user-friendliness. CONCLUSIONS: In ourpreliminary experience the exoscope new technology is a safe and effective toolfor spinal cord minimally invasive decompression in thoracolumbar burstfractures. The stereoscopic vision provided by 3D images seems to be crucial inhand eye coordination. There are clear advantages in terms of maneuverability,wide field of view, deep focus, and more comfortable posture for the spinalsurgeon.

TI  - Determination of chlorothalonil levels through inhibitory effect on papainactivity at protein-decorated liquid crystal interfaces.
PG  - 292
LID - 10.1007/s00604-022-05396-1 [doi]
AB  - A liquid crystal (LC)-based assay was developed to detect chlorothalonil (CHL).The detection principle is based on (i) the electrostatic interaction between thepositively charged protein protamine (PRO) with the negatively chargedphospholipid dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) sodium salt (DOPG)and (ii) the CHL-mediated inhibition of papain (PAP) activity. The aqueous/LCinterface was decorated with a monolayer of DOPG and PRO that self-assembled via electrostatic interactions. PAP can hydrolyze PRO, resulting in the realignmentof an LC by DOPG, inducing a shift in the LC response from bright to dark. Theaddition of CHL can inhibit the activity of PAP, leading to the attraction of PROto DOPG and the consequent disruption of the LC orientation. The orientationchange of the LC in the presence or absence of CHL can be observed from thechanges in its optical appearance using a polarized light microscope. Underoptimal conditions, the developed assay achieved a detection limit of 0.196 pgmL(-1) within a range of determination of 0.65-200 pg mL(-1). The selectivity of the assay was verified in the presence of carbendazim and imidacloprid. Thepractical application of the proposed assay was demonstrated by its use todetermine the levels of CHL in food extracts and environmental samples, whichyielded recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD) in the ranges of87.39-99.663% and 1.03-6.32%, respectively.

PG  - 742
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03692-3 [doi]
AB  - Ambiguity surrounds the existence and morphology of the human fornicealcommissure. We combine advanced in-vivo tractography, multidirectional ex-vivofiber dissection, and multiplanar histological analysis to characterize thisstructure's anatomy. Across all 178 subjects, in-vivo fiber dissection based onthe Human Connectome Project 7 T MRI data identifies no interhemisphericconnections between the crura fornicis. Multidirectional ex-vivo fiber dissectionunder the operating microscope demonstrates the psalterium as a thin soft-tissue membrane spanning between the right and left crus fornicis, but exposes nocommissural fibers. Multiplanar histological analysis with myelin and Bielchowskysilver staining, however, visualizes delicate cruciform fibers extending between the crura fornicis, enclosed by connective tissue, the psalterium. The humanforniceal commissure is therefore much more delicate than previously describedand presented in anatomical textbooks. This finding is consistent with theobserved phylogenetic trend of a reduction of the forniceal commissure innon-human primates compared to non-primate eutherian mammals.

TI  - Functional Characterization, Antimicrobial Effects, and Potential AntibacterialMechanisms of NpHM4, a Derived Peptide of Nautilus pompilius Hemocyanin.
LID - 459 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20070459 [doi]
AB  - Hemocyanins present in the hemolymph of invertebrates are multifunctionalproteins that are responsible for oxygen transport and play crucial roles in the immune system. They have also been identified as a source of antimicrobialpeptides during infection in mollusks. Hemocyanin has also been identified in thecephalopod ancestor Nautilus, but antimicrobial peptides derived from thehemocyanin of Nautilus pompilius have not been reported. Here, the bactericidalactivity of six predicted peptides from N. pompilius hemocyanin and seven mutant peptides was analyzed. Among those peptides, a mutant peptide with 15 amino acids(1RVFAGFLRHGIKRSR15), NpHM4, showed relatively high antibacterial activity. NpHM4was determined to have typical antimicrobial peptide characteristics, including apositive charge (+5.25) and a high hydrophobic residue ratio (40%), and it waspredicted to form an alpha-helical structure. In addition, NpHM4 exhibitedsignificant antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (MBC = 30 muMfor Vibrio alginolyticus), with no cytotoxicity to mammalian cells even at a highconcentration of 180 microM. Upon contact with V. alginolyticus cells, weconfirmed that the bactericidal activity of NpHM4 was coupled with membranepermeabilization, which was further confirmed via ultrastructural images using a scanning electron microscope. Therefore, our study provides a rationalization forthe development and optimization of antimicrobial peptide from the cephalopodancestor Nautilus, paving the way for future novel AMP development with broadapplications.

TI  - Adhesion of Resin to Lithium Disilicate with Different Surface Treatments before and after Salivary Contamination-An In-Vitro Study.
LID - 286 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering9070286 [doi]
AB  - The salivary contamination occurring at the try-in procedures of lithiumdisilicate (LDS) can jeopardize their bond strength. Various laboratory reportshave concluded that applying 37% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) could be considered as apredictable way of removing salivary contaminants. An experimental method thatconsists of sealing the intaglio of the ceramic restorations with a layer ofcured adhesive could allow consequent time saving for dental practitioners. Itis, besides, necessary to establish an optimal decontamination protocol. Hence,this study aimed to determine the most efficient surface treatment, before andafter salivary contamination, by comparing the adhesion between resin and LDS. Inorder to do so, five groups of ten specimens (n = 10) each underwent thedifferent types of surface treatments before bonding, followed by 2500 cycles in the thermocycler. A shear bond strength (SBS) test was then conducted on auniversal testing machine (YLE GmbH Waldstrasse Bad Konig, Germany), followed by a fracture-type analysis on an optical microscope (Olympus BX53, Shinjuku, Tokyo,Japan). Statistical analysis was set with a level of significance of alpha =0.05. The surface treatment significantly affected the SBS results. Thedecontamination with HF (12.59 +/- 2.71 MPa) and H3PO4 (13.11 +/- 1.03 MPa)obtained the highest values, silanizing only before contamination obtainedintermediate values (11.74 +/- 3.49 MPa), and silanizing both before and afterthe salivary contamination (10.41 +/- 2.75 MPa) along with applying a bondingagent before contamination (9.65 +/- 1.99 MPa) resulted in the lowest values. In conclusion, H3PO4 proved to be efficient, thus, allowing the practitioner toavoid the clinical use of HF; it can, therefore, be considered as a validalternative. Presilanization and resilanization of specimens, along with applyinga bonding agent before contamination, did not yield satisfying results.

TI  - Simultaneous Optical Detection of Multiple Bacterial Species UsingNanometer-Scaled Metal-Organic Hybrids.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01188 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes a simple strategy to identify bacteria using the opticalproperties of the nanohybrid structures (NHs) of polymer-coated metalnanoparticles (NPs). NHs, in which many small NPs are encapsulated in polyanilineparticles, are useful optical labels because they produce strong scattered light.The light-scattering characteristics of NHs are strongly dependent on theconstituent metal elements of NPs. Gold NHs (AuNHs), silver NHs (AgNHs), andcopper NHs (CuNHs) produce white, reddish, and bluish scattered light,respectively. Moreover, unlike NPs, the color of the scattered light does notchange even when NHs are aggregated. Introducing an antibody into NHs inducesantigen-specific binding to cells, enabling the identification of bacteria based on light scattering. Multiple bacterial species adsorbed on the slide can beidentified within a single field of view under a dark field microscope based onthe color of the scattered light. Therefore, it is a useful development forsafety risk assessments at manufacturing sites, such as those for foods,beverages, and drugs, and environmental surveys that require rapid detection ofmultiple bacteria.

TI  - Observing Dislocations Transported by Twin Boundaries in Al Thin Film: UnusualPathways for Dislocation-Twin Boundary Interactions.
LID - 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c01763 [doi]
AB  - Twins are generally regarded as obstacles to dislocations in face-centered cubic metals and can modify individual dislocations by locking them in twin boundaries or obliging them to dissociate. Through in situ tensile experiments on Al thinfilm in a transmission electron microscope, we report a dynamic process ofdislocations being transported by twin lamella via periodic twinning anddetwinning at the atomic scale. Following this process, a 60 degrees dislocation first transforms into a sessile step of the twin boundary, then migrates understress as a step and finally reverts back into a 60 degrees dislocation. Ourresults reveal a novel evolution route of dislocations by a dislocation-twininteraction where the twins act as transport vehicles rather than as obstacles.The potential implications of this mechanism on toughening are also discussed.

TI  - The Hidden Flower in WS2 Flakes: A Combined Nanomechanical and Tip-Enhanced RamanExploration.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03441 [doi]
AB  - We report on tungsten disulfide (WS2) flakes grown by chemical vapor deposition(CVD), which exhibit a flower-like surface structure above the primary few-layer flake with a triangular shape. The fine structure is only revealed in themechanical, chemical, and electronic properties of the flake but not in thetopography. The origin of this structure is the peculiar one-step growth duringthe CVD process that permits to control the sulfur concentration at any time. Ahigh concentration of S at the onset of the deposition process leads to a rapidgrowth of the flake, resulting in tungsten vacancies. Reducing the sulfurconcentration toward the end of the growth slows down the reaction and leads tosulfur vacancies. These microscale domains were studied by confocal- andtip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy revealing their chemical composition with highspatial resolution. A strong quenching of the photoluminescence in thetungsten-vacancy domains is observed. Atomic force microscope measurements,performed in intermittent contact mode, force modulation mode (including lateral force mode), and PeakForce quantitative nanomechanics mode, show that themechanical properties of these domains differ. Within the tungsten-vacancydomains, the adhesion force is reduced, while the friction force increased.Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements show that the electronic properties ofthe flakes are modulated by these domains. The combined nanomechanical andnanospectroscopy measurements provide detailed insights on the inhomogeneoussurface properties of the single WS2 flake, further highlighting how itsmultidomain properties can be finely tuned using CVD.

AB  - In our daily plastic surgery practice, we have seen many chronic wounds that neednew biotechnology to help and improve wound healing. Stem cells play a crucialrole in regenerative medicine. Many pre-clinical researches had reported thebeneficial paracrine effects of stem cell therapy for chronic wounds.Cell-friendly scaffolds may provide the protection and three-dimensional spacerequired for adherence of stem cells, thus allowing these stem cells toproliferate and differentiate for treatment purpose. A successful scaffold mayenhance the effects of stem cell therapy. In this presented series, the authorsattempted to identify the most suitable scaffolds from several commerciallyavailable wound dressings that could sustain adipose-derived stromal/progenitorcells (ADSCs) survival. Therefore, we isolated ADSCs containing the greenfluorescent protein (GFP) from GFP transgenic rats. The GFP (+) ADSCs and theirprogenies could be easily observed using a fluorescence microscope. Moreover, we analyzed the cytokines secreted in condition medium (CM) to understand theactivities of ADSCs in various dressings. Our results showed that the foamdressings, hydrofiber, chitosan, and alginate plus carboxymethylcellulose wereidentified as the most suitable dressing materials. Higher concentrations oftransforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) were observed 48 h after loading them with GFP (+) ADSCs. Therefore,multiple topical cell therapy using ADSCs can be performed by applying suitabledressing scaffolds without repeated needle injections to deliver the stem cellsinto the wound bed. Based on their fluorescence property, the GFP (+) ADSCs canalso possibly be used for testing biocompatibility of medical materials in thefuture.

AB  - Background: Drugs based on synthetic lethality have advantages such as inhibitingtumor growth and affecting normal tissue in vivo. However, specific targets forosteosarcoma have not been acknowledged yet. In this study, a non-targeted butcontrollable drug delivery system has been applied to selectively enhancesynthetic lethality in osteosarcoma in vitro, using the magnetic-driven hydrogel microrobots. Methods: In this study, EPZ015666, a PRMT5 inhibitor, was selectedas the synthetic lethality drug. Then, the drug was carried by hydrogelmicrorobots containing Fe3O4. Morphological characteristics of the microrobotswere detected using electron microscopy. In vitro drug effect was detected by theCCK-8 assay kit, Western blotting, etc. Swimming of microrobots was observed by atiming microscope. Selective inhibition was verified by cultured tumors in anincreasing magnetic field. Results: Genomic mutation of MTAP deletion occurredcommonly in pan-cancer in the TCGA database (nearly 10.00%) and in osteosarcomain the TARGET database (23.86%). HOS and its derivatives, 143B and HOS/MNNG, weredetected by MTAP deletion according to the CCLE database and RT-PCR. EPZ015666,the PRMT5 inhibitor, could reduce the SDMA modification and inhibition of tumorgrowth of 143B and HOS/MNNG. The hydrogel microrobot drug delivery system wassynthesized, and the drug was stained by rhodamine. The microrobots were powered actively by a magnetic field. A simulation of the selected inhibition ofmicrorobots was performed and lower cell viability of tumor cells was detected byadding a high dose of microrobots. Conclusion: Our magnetic-driven drug delivery system could carry synthetic lethality drugs. Meanwhile, the selective inhibitionof this system could be easily controlled by programming the strength of themagnetic field.

AB  - Recent improvements in molecular treatment and gene therapy led to discoveringnovel cancer remedies. Antisense LNA GapmeRs is a state-of-the-art molecularresearch field for diagnosing and treating various cancer types. Acute myeloidleukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy defined by the rapidaccumulation and malignant proliferation of immature myeloid progenitors. SOX12is a new potential target for acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, SOX12 wasblocked by antisense LNA GapmeRs (ALG) in human AML cell lines (KG1 and M07e).Cells were transfected with Gapmer anti-SOX12 at 24, 48, and 72 hpost-transfection. Transfection efficiency was assessed by a fluorescentmicroscope. Furthermore, evaluation of SOX12, TWIST1, CTNNB1, CASP3, and CASP9expression was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. SOX12 expression was decreased remarkably in the ALG group. Moreover, SOX12 knockdown wasassociated with a decrease in TWIST1 and CTNNB1 expression. Besides,downregulation of SOX12 in both cell lines could induce apoptosis, probablythrough upregulation of CASP3 and CASP9. The findings reveal that SOX12 knockdowncould be a new target for reducing AML cells proliferation through antisensetherapy approach.

AB  - The repair of peripheral facial paralysis is a long-term problem in neurosurgery,and nerve repair is often needed. Due to the high differentiation of nerve tissueand the slow regeneration of peripheral nerve fibers, the repair effect afterperipheral nerve injury is not ideal. In recent years, studies have found thatthe inflammatory response after peripheral nerve injury also has an importantimpact on the repair of peripheral nerve defects. This study depends on theutilization of traditional needle therapy in the treatment of fringe facial loss of motion, and the clinical adequacy of needle therapy in addition to nerve fixin the intense period of fringe facial loss of motion was seen with an electronmagnifying lens. Endeavor to give significant exploration results to the clinicaltreatment of fringe facial loss of motion gives a straightforward, simple,protected, and successful new treatment innovation for the clinical treatment of the infection and enriches the treatment plan for peripheral facial paralysis.Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that 21 days after theartificial nerve was repaired, the nerve injury showed different degrees ofrecovery, and the myelin sheath was forming and gradually wrapping the new axons,which was similar to the catheter group (NC) and hydrogel group (HC). Incontrast, the myelin layer of the fibroblast group (FHC) is more obvious, and therepair effect is better. In the maintenance of fringe nerve surrenders,irritation is an unavoidable interaction, and moderate needle therapy is usefulto advance the maintenance of fringe nerve abandons. Talking about the law ofnerve fix reaction in fringe nerve imperfection fix is helpful to the examinationof fringe nerve deformity fix. Tests have shown that utilizing needle therapy andmoxibustion joined with nerve fixes has accomplished great outcomes in thetreatment of fringe facial loss of motion, and the patient's recuperation ratehas expanded by over 30%.

AB  - In this study, the modulatory effects of anthracene (ANT) and benz[a]anthracene(BEN) on biochemical markers associated with neurodegeneration were assessed inmouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22). Neuronal cells were cultured andexposed to ANT and BEN (25-125 microM) for 5 days, and the cell viability wasdetermined via MTT assay. Morphological characteristics of the cells wereassessed using a compound microscope. Biochemical parameters such asacetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) and adenosine deaminase(ADA) activities as well as oxidative stress biomarkers (catalase [CAT],glutathione -S- transferase [GST] activities and Glutathione [GSH] levels) andnitric oxide [NO] levels were assessed after cells were treated with ANT and BEN for two days. The results showed that cell viability reduced with an increase in exposure time. After the fifth day of treatment, BEN and ANT (125 microM) reducedpercentage viability to 41 and 38.1%, respectively. Light micrographs showedshrinkage of cells, neuronal injury and cell death in cells treated with higherconcentrations of BEN and ANT (50 and 125 microM). Furthermore, AChE and MAOactivities reduced significantly after treatment for 48 h with ANT and BEN. Asignificant decrease in CAT and GST activities and low GSH levels were observedafter treatment with BEN and ANT. However, both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons caused a significant increase in ADA activity and NO levels. These resultssuggest that ANT and BEN may induce neurodegeneration in neuronal cells viaoxidative stress-induced-neuronal injury, disruption of cholinergic,monoaminergic and purinergic transmission, and increased nitric oxide levels.

AB  - Silica-decorated ferrite nanoparticles, a new kind, coated with ceric ammoniumnitrate (CAN), have been prepared successfully by simple coprecipitationtechniques. Powder X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (PXRD), Fouriertransform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission-scanning electronmicroscope (FE-SEM), wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX),energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), inductive coupled plasma-optical emissionspectroscopy (ICP-OES), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques were usedto characterize these nanoparticles. The catalysts are further studied forcatalytic activity in solvent-free conditions. Importantly, these nanoparticleshave been collected from the reaction mixture using an external magnet andrecycled up to minimum of 15 cycles with no substantial loss of catalyticcharacteristics.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the causes of osteoporosis-relatedskeletal fragility in postmenopausal women. We hypothesize that bone fragility inthese individuals is largely due to mineral, and/or intrinsic material propertiesin the osteocyte lacunar/peri-lacunar regions of bone tissue. Innovativemeasurements with nanoscale resolution, including scanning electron microscope(SEM), an atomic force microscope that is integrated with infrared spectroscopy(AFM-IR), and nanoindentation, were used to characterize osteocyte lacunar andperi-lacunar properties in bone biopsies from fracturing (Cases) and matched(Age, BMD), non-fracturing (Controls) postmenopausal healthy women. In theperi-lacunar space, the nanoindentation results show that the modulus andhardness of the Controls are lower than the Cases. The AFM-IR resultsconclusively show that the mineral matrix, maturity (peak) (except in outer/farregions in Controls) were greater in Controls than in Cases. Furthermore, theseresults indicate that while mineral-to-matrix area ratio tend to be greater, the mineral maturity and crystallinity peak ratio "near" lacunae is greater than atregions "far" or more distance from lacunae in the Controls only. Due to theheterogeneity of bone structure, additional measurements are needed to providemore convincing evidence of altered lacunar characteristics and changes in theperi-lacunar bone as mechanisms related to postmenopausal women and fragility.Such findings would motivate new osteocyte-targeted treatments to reducefragility fracture risks in these groups.

AB  - According to WHO warnings, the antibiotic resistance crisis is a severe healthissue in the 21st century, attributed to the overuse and misuse of thesemedications. Consequently, the dramatic spreading rate of the drug-resistantmicrobial pathogens strains. The microbiological, biochemical tests andantibiotic sensitivity identified the bacteria's multi-drug resistance (MDR).About 150 different clinical samples were taken from hospitalized patients, both males, and females, ranging from 9 to 68 years. Gram-negative strains were(70.0%), while Gram-positive isolates were (30.0%). Among sixteen antibiotics,antibiotic susceptibility of imipenem was found to be the most efficient drugagainst most of the Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates, followed bymeropenem, depending on the culture and sensitivity results. All the experimentalbacteria showed multidrug-resistant phenomena. In this study, green synthesizedsilver (Cur-Ag NPs) and zinc oxide (Cur-ZnO NPs) nanoparticles in the presence ofcurcumin extract. In addition, their physicochemical properties have beencharacterized using different techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy,transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fouriertransform infrared (FT-IR), and colloidal properties techniques. Furthermore,curcumin-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibited solid antimicrobial actionagainst the experimental bacterial isolates, except Proteus vulgaris (i.e., P.vulgaris). Curcumin-capped zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) found antimicrobialactivity against all tested strains. Finally, the minimum inhibitoryconcentration exhibited values from 3.9 to 15.6 mug ml(-1), which is too smallcompared to other traditional antibiotics. In addition, the green-synthesizedCur-Ag NPs and Cur-ZnO NPs showed good biocompatibility.

AB  - Objectives: The current methods employed for esophageal endoscopic mucosalresection (EMR) involve the risk of adverse postprocedural complications.Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new method to prevent stenosis followinga resection procedure using human amniotic epithelial cells in a porcine model.Methods: With the consent of a woman who underwent a cesarean section, amnioticepithelial cells were isolated from the amniotic membrane of the deliveredplacenta. Six swine were used for this study. Under general anesthesia, four EMRsusing cap-fitted microscope ulcers were performed on each porcine esophagus. Ofthe four ulcers, the two on the oral side were treated by injecting humanamniotic epithelial (AE group) cells, and the remaining two on the anal side wereleft untreated (control group). One week after the procedure, the swine weresacrificed, and the ulcers were evaluated. The epithelialization rate wascalculated by dividing the length of the epithelialized portion of each sectionby the length of the ulcer, which was determined using an optical microscope.Moreover, the mucosal thickening in each section was measured in terms ofdiameter. Results: The epithelialization rate was significantly higher in the AE group than in the control group. Mucosal thickening was not significantlydifferent between the groups. Conclusions: Transplanting amniotic epithelialcells into the ulcer promoted ulcer epithelialization. Amniotic epithelial celltransplantation is a potential method for the management of ulcer scar stenosisfollowing esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.

AB  - Objectives: Since carbonized clots and tissue (debris) tend to adhere firmly tothe tip of the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) knife as the procedureproceeds, manual removing the firm debris is often challenging andtime-consuming. Recently, effective ultrasonic cleaning for other medical deviceshas been reported. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether ultrasoniccleaning is effective in removing the debris on the insulation-tipped diathermic (IT) knife-2. Methods: This study was an ex-vivo experimental randomized study. Atotal of 40 IT knife-2 knives with debris on their tip surfaces were prepared andrandomly assigned to two groups (Group A and Group B). The knives in Group A werecleaned using the conventional scrubbing method for 30 s (conventional cleaningmethod), while those in Group B were cleaned using a combined method of scrubbingfor 20 s and ultrasonic cleaning for 10 s (combined ultrasonic cleaning method). The tip electrode of the knife after cleaning was photographed under a microscope(40x). The 40 images of the knives were evaluated by independent threeendoscopists and two clinical engineers using the five-step evaluation criteriaranging from cleaning score 1 (dirty) to 5 (clean). Results: The mean cleaningscore of 3.78 (range: 2.33-4.67) in Group B was significantly higher than that of1.68 (range: 1.00-2.83) in Group A. Conclusions: The combined ultrasonic cleaningmethod could remove debris adhering to the IT knife-2 more effectively than theconventional cleaning method. Ultrasonic cleaning may be applied for real-worldESD.

AB  - Long-term live-cell imaging technology has emerged in the study of cell cultureand development, and it is expected to elucidate the differentiation orreprogramming morphology of cells and the dynamic process of interaction between cells. There are some advantages to this technique: it is noninvasive,high-throughput, low-cost, and it can help researchers explore phenomena that areotherwise difficult to observe. Many challenges arise in the real-time process,for example, low-quality micrographs are often obtained due to unavoidable human factors or technical factors in the long-term experimental period. Moreover, somecore dynamics in the developmental process are rare and fleeting in imagingobservation and difficult to recapture again. Therefore, this study proposes adeep learning method for microscope cell image enhancement to reconstruct sharpimages. We combine generative adversarial nets and various loss functions to makeblurry images sharp again, which is much more convenient for researchers to carryout further analysis. This technology can not only make up the blurry images ofcritical moments of the development process through image enhancement but alsoallows long-term live-cell imaging to find a balance between imaging speed andimage quality. Furthermore, the scalability of this technology makes the methods perform well in fluorescence image enhancement. Finally, the method is tested in long-term live-cell imaging of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derivedcardiomyocyte differentiation experiments, and it can greatly improve the imagespace resolution ratio.

AB  - In order to solve the great difficulties in cancer prevention, diagnosis, andtreatment, a preparation method of iridium oxide nanocomposites under themicroscope was proposed in this paper. Through a retrospective analysis of anexperiment, IrOx nanoparticles were prepared by direct hydrothermal hydrolysisand loaded with chemotherapy drug adriamycin to construct nanodrug-loaded complexIrOx@DOX. At the same time, IrOx, as a sound-sensitive agent, can produce ROSunder US irradiation, amplify intracellular oxidative stress, accelerate tumorcell death, and finally achieve the effect of SDT chemotherapy synergistictherapy. The experimental results show that IrOx@DOX has the dual response of pH and US, and the inhibition rates are 27%, 57%, and 76%, respectively. At the sametime, ultrasound not only can enhance the uptake of nanoparticles by cells butalso can promote the release of DOX in cells, which provides a basis forsubsequent SDT chemotherapy synergistic therapy. Conclusion. Iridium oxidenanocomposite DOX combined with SDT can obtain a good therapeutic effect, whichhas positive feedback on the efficacy of chemotherapy and the therapeutic effect of cancer surgery.

TI  - Enzymatic Active Release of Violacein Present in Nanostructured Lipid Carrier by Lipase Encapsulated in 3D-Bioprinted Chitosan-Hydroxypropyl MethylcelluloseMatrix With Anticancer Activity.
PG  - 914126
LID - 10.3389/fchem.2022.914126 [doi]
AB  - Violacein (Viol) is a bacterial purple water-insoluble pigment synthesized byChromobacterium violaceum and other microorganisms that display many beneficialtherapeutic properties including anticancer activity. Viol was produced, purifiedin our laboratory, and encapsulated in a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). The NLC is composed of the solid lipid myristyl myristate, an oily lipid mixturecomposed of capric and caprylic acids, and the surfactant poloxamer P188. Dormantlipase from Rhizomucor miehei was incorporated into the NLC-Viol to develop anactive release system. The NLC particle size determined by dynamic lightscattering brings around 150 nm particle size and zeta approximately -9.0 mV withor without lipase, but the incorporation of lipase increase the PdI from 0.241 to0.319 ( approximately 32%). For scaffold development, a 2.5 hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/chitosan ratio was obtained after optimization of a composite forextrusion in a 3D-bioprinter developed and constructed in our laboratory. FinalViol encapsulation efficiency in the printings was over 90%. Kinetic release ofthe biodye at pH = 7.4 from the mesh containing NLC-lipase showed roughly 20%Viol fast release than without the enzyme. However, both Viol kinetic releasesdisplayed similar profiles at pH = 5.0, where the lipase is inactive. The kineticrelease of Viol from the NLC-matrices was modeled and the best correlation wasfound with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model (R(2) = 0.95) with n < 0.5 suggesting aFickian release of Viol from the matrices. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)images of the NLC-meshes showed significant differences before and after Viol'srelease. Also, the presence of lipase dramatically increased the gaps in theinterchain mesh. XRD and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses of theNLC-meshes showed a decrease in the crystalline structure of the composites with the incorporation of the NLC, and the decrease of myristyl myristate in the mesh can be attributed to the lipase activity. TGA profiles of the NLC-meshes showedhigh thermal stability than the individual components. Cytotoxic studies in A549 and HCT-116 cancer cell lines revealed high anticancer activity of the matrixmediated by mucoadhesive chitosan, plus the biological synergistic activities of violacein and lipase.

AB  - A major paradigm shift in the field of nanobiotechnology is the invention of aneco-friendly, economical, and green approach for synthesis of metalnanoparticles. In the present study, we have synthesized gold nanoparticles(AuNPs) using aqueous extracts of marine brown seaweed Sargassum longifolium. Thesynthesized nanoparticle was subjected to characterization using differenttechniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electronmicroscope, and elemental dispersive X-ray diffraction. Further, the seaweedextract and the synthesized AuNPs were evaluated for its anticancer effect using MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells besides in vitro antioxidant effect. The formationof S. longifolium-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles was demonstrated byUV-Vis spectroscopy. Presence of elemental gold was confirmed by EDX analysis.TEM analysis demonstrated spherical morphology of the synthesized AuNPs and SEManalysis revealed the particle size to be in the range of 10-60 nm. The FTIRshowed the presence of hydroxyl functional groups. The toxicity of S. longifoliumextract and the synthesized AuNPs was tested using brine shrimp lethality assayat different concentrations with results showing both seaweed extract and AuNPsto be nontoxic. Both S. longifolium and AuNPs exhibited significant antioxidantactivity by scavenging DPPH free radicals and H2O2 radicals. Significantantiproliferative effect was observed against MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. It wasalso shown that the seaweed extract and the AuNPs induced cytotoxicity in celllines by mechanism of apoptosis. In conclusion, this study provided insight onAuNPs synthesized from S. longifolium as a potent antioxidant and anticanceragent.

AB  - This study aimed to encapsulate walnut peptides with different molecular weights (crude peptides, 5-10 kDa and < 5 kDa) within nanoliposomes. The peptides withmolecular weight (MW) of 5-10 kDa (F2) was chosen as a representative sample toindicate the formation mechanism of nanoliposomes using scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The storage andsimulated digestion experiment were carried out to evaluate the protective effectof nanoliposomes loading walnut peptides. Our results indicated that the aminoacid composition was affected by peptide MW, and F2 exhibited the highest contentof hydrophobic amino acids content. The MW of peptides also affected thedistribution of the peptide of nanoliposomes, resulting in changes in particlesize, zeta-potential, and encapsulation efficiency. The SEM exhibited that a highconcentration of nanoliposomes might result in phospholipid fusion and largerparticle diameters. The TEM showed individual nanoliposomes had spherical, smoothand full vesicle structures. The nanoliposomes could improve the stability ofwalnut peptides during storage. The maximum peptides retention after in vitrodigestion was 61.6%, indicating a better sustained release in gastric digestion. The present study suggested that nanoliposomes can offer adequate protection tothe walnut peptides during storage and digestion.

AB  - Background: African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) affects livestock productivityin sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to determine cattle AAT's prevalence and associated risk factors in Lambwe Valley, Kenya. Methods: In a cross-sectionalsurvey, livestock owners were recruited from four villages of Lambwe in Homa Bay,Kenya. Blood samples were collected from the jugular veins of cattle, and buffycoat smears were examined under a microscope. Parasites were further detectedusing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a semistructured questionnaire,livestock owners were interviewed on their knowledge of AAT and controlpractices. Chi-square and multilevel models were used for the analysis. Results: The overall prevalence was 15.63% (71/454). Trypanosoma vivax 10.31% and T.congolense Savannah 6.01% were the common species and subspecies. A total of 61livestock keepers were involved in the study. Of these, 91.80% (56/61) knew AAT, and 90.16% (55/61) could describe the symptoms well and knew tsetse fly bite astransmission mode. Self-treatment (54.09%; 33/61) was common, with up to 50.00%of the farmers using drugs frequently. Isometamidium (72.13%; 44/61) anddiminazene (54.09%; 33/61) were drugs frequently used. Although 16.39% (10/61) ofthe farmers claimed to use chemoprophylactic treatment, 6/10 did not use theright drugs. Animals (92.1%; 58/63) with clinical signs had positive infections. Villages closer to the national park recorded a higher prevalence. Infectionswere higher in cattle owned by those self-treating (27.23%; 58/213), those using drug treatment without vector control (27.62%; 50/181), those using single-drugtherapy, and those practicing communal grazing (20.00%; 59/295). Clinical signsstrongly associate with positive infections under multilevel modeling.Conclusion: Cattle trypanosomiasis is prevalent in the Lambwe region of Kenya.This is influenced by inappropriate control practices, communal grazing, and the proximity of farms to the national park. In addition, clinical signs of thedisease have a strong association with infections.

AB  - Objective: Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) is downregulated inepilepsy, however, the role of Cu-Zn SOD in epilepsy remains unclear. Methods:Based on the pilocarpine hydrochloride-induced rat model of epilepsy,cortical-striatum brain slices of rats were examined based on field excitatorypost-synaptic potentials. Pathological changes were observed by transmissionelectron microscope. Also using SH-SY5Y cells, flow cytometry and TUNEL staining were applied to investigate cell apoptosis, and ELISA was applied to detect SODactivity. In addition, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to detectSCN2A/Nrf2/HO-1 gene and protein expression levels, respectively. Results: Cu-Zn SOD over-expression suppressed epilepsy in vivo. In addition, Cu-Zn SOD knockdownnotably decreased SOD activity and induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, Cu-Zn SOD silencing decreased the levels of SCN2A, Nrf2 and HO-1. Lastly, Cu-ZnSOD was shown to modulate the NaV1.2/Nrf2/HO-1 axis in rats. Significance: Inthis model, Cu-Zn SOD attenuated epilepsy and was shown to alter the expressionlevel of proteins of the NaV1.2 /Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway, indicating thatCu-Zn SOD might be a target for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - In this research, an electrochemical sensor was fabricated employing themetal-organic framework (MOF) deposited glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for thesensing copper ions in water with high sensitivity. The porous nanostructured MOFwas characterized through Transmission electron microscope, scanning electronmicroscope and X-ray diffraction analysis. The Bi-MOF nanostructure deposited GCE(Bi-MOF/GCE) was fabricated by drop-casting a suspension of Bi-MOF in water onGCE surface. The performance of modified electrode in the presence and absence ofheavy metal ions such as Cd(2+), Hg(2+) As(3+), Pb(2+) and Cu(2+) was determined by the cyclic voltammetry in deionised water within the scan rate range of 25 and300mVs(-1). The Bi-MOF/GCE displayed highest anodic and cathodic peak current forCu(2+) ions than other metal ions, which was enhanced linearly within the scanrate range of 10-100mVs(-1). Under the employed experimental conditions, thefabricated Bi-MOF/GCE based electrochemical sensor showed an outstanding routine in the determination of copper with a lowest sensing limit of 1x10(-5)M, widelinear range variation, strong interaction between metal ions and Bi-MOF. It has long-term stability and good reproducibility. The Bi-MOF/GCE electrode wassuccessfully tested to detect Cu(2+) in tap water with acceptable results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery reconstruction (HAR) for liver transplantation iscrucial for successful outcomes. We evaluated transplantation outcome improvementthrough continual technical refinements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HAR was performedin 1448 living donor liver transplants by a single plastic surgeon from 2008 to2020. Difficult HARs were defined as graft or recipient hepatic artery </=2mm,size discrepancy (>/=2 to 1), multiple hepatic arteries, suboptimal quality,intimal dissection of graft or recipient hepatic artery (HA), and immediate redo during transplantation. Technique refinements include early vessel injuryrecognition, precise HA dissection, the use of clips to ligate branches, anoblique cut for all HARs, a modified funneling method for size discrepancy,liberal use of an alternative artery to replace a pathologic HA, andreconstruction of a second HA for grafts with dual hepatic arteries in the graft.RESULTS: Difficult HARs were small HA (21.35%), size discrepancy (12.57%),multiple hepatic arteries (11.28%), suboptimal quality (31.1%), intimaldissection (20.5%), and immediate redo (5.18%). The overall hepatic arterythrombosis (HAT) rate was 3.04% in this series. The average HAT rate during thelast 4 years (2017-2020) was 1.46% (6/408), which was significantly lower thanthe average HAT rate from 2008 to 2016 (39/1040, 3.8%) with a statisticalsignificance (p=0.025). Treatment for posttransplant HAT included anastomosisafter trim back (9), reconstruction using alternatives (19), and nonsurgicaltreatment with urokinase (9). CONCLUSION: Careful examination of the HA undersurgical microscope and selection of the appropriate recipient HA are key tosuccessful reconstruction. Through continual technical refinements, we can reduceHA complications to the lowest degree.

LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22137-2 [doi]
AB  - The copolymer beads prepared by suspension polymerisation were decorated withMnO2 nanoparticles and successfully implemented for the efficient removal oftoxic organic contaminants from water. Copolymer-MnO2 nanocomposite was furtheranalysed using XRD, SEM and optical microscope. The SEM images showed the surfacecharacteristics of MnO2 nanoparticles on copolymer beads. The efficiency of thecopolymer-MnO2 nanocomposite for the removal of model pollutant methylene blueand rhodamine B is then analysed by changing the concentration of pollutant. The results obtained exhibited 18.45 mg/g for methylene blue adsorption and 3.125mg/g for rhodamine B. The adsorption equilibrium results were fitted to Langmuir adsorption isotherm for both methylene blue and rhodamine B adsorption. Thedesorption studies were performed for five consecutive cycles, and material wasshowing good regenerating capacity towards both organic pollutants. The obtained results show that copolymer-MnO2 nanocomposite is an efficient material for theremoval of organic contaminants from wastewater.

TI  - Mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose accelerate the progression of coloncancer by inducing a MT-CAFs phenotype via TRPC3/NF-KB axis.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03017-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) help shape the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression, and ion channels might play a critical role in this process. The objective of the present studywas to explore the function and mechanism of MT-CAFs on progression of coloncancer. METHODS: Here, a gene chip was used for a general analysis of geneexpression changes in MSC-transformed CAF cells (MT-CAFs). Bioinformatic tool andwestern blot screened out the ion channel protein TRPC3 with significantlyincreased expression, and identify the function through two-photon microscope.The progression of cancer was detected via MTS, transwell and Wound Healing.ELISA deected the secretion of inflammation factors. TRPC3/NF-KB axis wasidentified by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: TRPC3 can causedcalcium influx, which further activated the NF-KB signaling pathway. Knockdown orinhibition of TRPC3 in MSCs significantly reduced the activation of NF-KB, anddecreased the growth, migration, and invasion of MT-CAFs. After TRPC3 knockdown, the ability of MT- CAFs to promote tumor migration and invasion was impaired.Conversely, the upregulation of TRPC3 expression in MT-CAFs had the oppositeeffect. In vivo, TRPC3 expressed on MSCs also contributed to the tumorigenesisand progression of cancer cells. In addition, the Oncomine and GEPIA databasesshowed that TRPC3 expression is higher in colon cancer tissues compared withnormal colon tissues, and was positively correlated with the expression of theCAF genes alpha-smooth muscle (alpha-SMA/ACTA2) and fibroblast activation proteinAlpha. The disease-free survival of patients with positive TRPC3 expression inMSCs was significantly shorter than those with negative expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TRPC3 expressed on MT-CAFs plays a critical role intumor progression via the NF-KB signaling pathway, and is correlated with poorprognosis in colon cancer patients. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a novel therapeutictarget for the treatment of colon cancer.

AB  - Lysozymes, acting as antimicrobial molecules, play a vital role in the host'sinnate immune response to pathogen infections. In the present study, a g-typelysozyme gene termed Tf-LyzG from roughskin sculpin, Trachidermus fasciatus wasfirstly reported. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tf-LyzG contained 188residues and possessed conserved catalytic residues (Glu(71), Asp(84), andAsp(95)). Gene expression analysis revealed that Tf-LyzG was widely distributedin the tested eleven tissues with the highest expression in the gill and could besignificantly induced post lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. The lysozymeactivity of the purified recombinant protein (rTf-LyzG) was found to be mostactive at pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. rTf-LyzG exhibited a wide spectrum of potentbacteriolytic activity against four Gram-positive bacteria and six Gram-negative bacteria. It also displayed a high affinity to polysaccharides on bacteriasurfaces including LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and peptidoglycan (PGN).rTf-LyzG was capable of binding and agglutinating all nine bacteria. Flowcytometry assay further revealed that rTf-LyzG could disrupt the membrane ofMicrococcus lysodeikticus which is confirmed by scanning electron microscope(SEM) analysis that reveals blebs around the bacterial cell membrane. In summary,these data indicate that Tf-LyzG is of great importance in the fish immuneresponse against pathogens invasion.

AB  - Non-enzymatic sensing of chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been demonstrated overstructurally functionalized the ternary bio nanocomposite comprised of cupricoxide, sodium alginate, and polyaniline-based hybrid (CuO/SA-g-PANI) basedelectrode using a laboratory designed portable potentiometric set up. Theprepared composite and constituents were characterized for structure, morphology,and physical properties with the help of fourier transform infrared, X-raydiffraction, Scanning electron microscope, and other relevant standard methods.The obtained results revealed the formation of porous, electrical conductivity,structurally functionalized, responsiveness composite due to molecularengineering, and structural synergism for sensing applications. Further, the filmof the prepared composite was explored as the electrode for nonenzymaticpotentiometric sensing of residual chlorpyrifos in synthetic and natural samplei.e., tap water, soil, mango, and cabbage. The sensor exhibits a wider sensingrange 1.0-120.0 muM, improved sensitivity 1.8790 mV.muM(-1).cm(-2), detectionlimit 0.375 muM, response time 120 s, recovery time 16 s with 99.80 % accuracy,and stability of 72 days at neutral 7.0 pH and ambient temperature i.e. 25degrees C. Further, the sensing mechanism has been also explained on the basis ofstructural change in CPF and electrode materials due to their surface interactionalong with formation induced electrode potential.

AB  - Passivation of soil heavy metals using environmental materials is an importantmethod or important in situ remediation measure. There are more studies oninorganic environmental materials for heavy metal passivation, but not enoughstudies on organic and their composite environmental materials with inorganicones. In order to reveal the passivation effect of coal-based ammoniated humicacid (CAHA), biochemical humic acid (BHA), biochar (BC) and other organic typesand inorganic environmental materials such as zeolites (ZL) on soil heavy metals and their biological effectiveness. The microstructures of these materials wereanalyzed by Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The main components of theenvironmental materials were analyzed by Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS),Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction spectrum(XRD) to elucidate the mechanism of passivation of heavy metals in soil by these environmental materials. The study was conducted to investigate the effects ofdifferent types of environmental materials and their combinations on thepassivation effect and biological effectiveness of Pb and Cd complexcontamination in soil by means of soil incubation and pot experiments usingsingle-factor and multifactor multilevel orthogonal experimental designs. Soilincubation experiments proved that the effective state of soil Pb and Cd in T7was reduced by 13.40% and 11.07%, respectively. The extreme difference analysisdetermined the optimized formulation of soil lead and cadmium passivation as BHA:CAHA: BC: ZL = 3.5:5:20:10. The pot experiment proved that the application ofcomposite environmental materials led to the reduction of lead and cadmiumcontent and increase of biomass of Pak-choi, and the optimal dosage of optimized composite environmental materials was 23.1 g/kg.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic trans-canal tympanoplasty type I (ETT) is graduallydiffusing worldwide. It mainly allows less invasive surgery in children withrespect to a microscope approach by avoiding post-auricular access. The aim ofthis study is to illustrate our experience in endoscopic reconstruction oftympanic membrane, using autologous tragus perichondrium (TP) and non-autologous acellular porcine small intestinal sub-mucosa (SIS) as grafts. METHODS: BetweenJanuary 2011 and December 2020, the results of a prospective non-randomizedseries of consecutive ETT were analyzed. The primary outcome was closure rate at 6 months and secondary outcomes are closure rates associated with age, size ofperforation, type of perforation and middle ear status, presence ofmyringosclerosis, type of graft, status of contralateral ear, adenoidectomy andpre-postoperative ABG change. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSSstatistical package. RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen consecutive procedures,mean age 9.4 years (range 4-17 years), were evaluated. TP and SIS grafts wereused in 65 (56%) and 51 (44%) procedures, respectively. Mean duration of surgicalprocedure was 53 +/- 21 min for SIS and 77 +/- 18 min for TP (P = 0.001) Totalgraft intake was 82.8%; TP and SIS intake were 86.2% and 78.4% (P = 0.3),respectively. Graft intake w.r.t. in age stratified age groups was notstatistically significant. Average preoperative and postoperative air-bone gapwas 12.1 +/- 7.6 dB and 5.5 +/- 3.8 dB, respectively (P = 0.001). The difference in closure rates was not significant. Neither intra- nor postoperativecomplications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In children, ETT is an applicable andless invasive technique compared to the microscope and offers less morbidity. Theuse of SIS contributes additional less invasiveness to endoscopic surgery byavoiding tragus harvesting with a comparable success rate and grantingsignificantly less surgical duration.

AB  - Agomelatine (AGO) is a dual-functional drug. It uses as an antidepressant whenorally administrated and antiglaucomic when topically applied to the eye. Thisstudy aimed to formulate AGO into bilosomal vesicles for glaucoma treatment, asmodern studies pointed out the effect of topical AGO on intraocular pressure for the treatment of glaucoma. A modified ethanol injection technique was used forthe fabrication of AGO bilosomes according to a D-optimal design.Phosphatidylcholine (PC) to edge activator (EA) ratio, Hyaluronic acid percentage(HA%), and EA type were utilized as independent variables. The measured responseswere percent entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), polydispersityindex, zeta potential, percentage of drug released after 2 h (Q2h%), and 24 h(Q24h%). The optimal bilosomal formula (OB), with the desirability of 0.814 andthe composition of 2:1 PC: EA ratio, 0.26% w/v HA and sodium cholate as EA, wassubjected to further in vitro characterizations and in vivo evaluation studies.The OB formula had EE% of 81.81 +/- 0.23%, PS of 432.45 +/- 0.85 nm, Q2h% of42.65 +/- 0.52%, and Q24h% of 75.14 +/- 0.39%. It demonstrated a higherelasticity than their corresponding niosomes with a typical spherical shape ofniosomes by using transmission electron microscope. It exhibited acceptablestability over three months. pH and Refractive index measurements together withthe histopathological study ensured that the OB formula is safe for the eye andcauses no ocular irritation or blurred vision. The OB formula showed superiority in the in vivo pharmacodynamics parameters over the AGO solution, so AGO-loadedbilosome could improve ocular delivery and the bioavailability of agomelatine.

TI  - The effects of mifepristone on the structure of human decidua and chorion and Baxand Bcl-2 expression at early stage of pregnancy.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s40360-022-00592-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone combined withmisoprostol is widely used to terminate early pregnancy in clinical practice. It has also been reported that mifepristone may cause cell death in decidual cellsand result in hemorrhage of the decidua and insufficient blood supply. However,little is known about the histological effects of mifepristone on human deciduaand chorion. METHODS: Histological and subcellular structural changes of decidua and chorionic villi from women taking mifepristone at early pregnancy times were examined by Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and transmission Electronmicroscope. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 was examinedby immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After 48 h of mifepristone administration, the decidua tissue and chorionic villus structures were altered in women within 39-49days of gestation and displayed varying degrees of degeneration and necrosis-likefeatures. Apoptotic events were observed in the decidua and chorionic villi ofearly pregnancy, and mifepristone treatment significantly increases the number ofapoptotic cells. The increased apoptotic events were concomitant with theincreased expression of Bax and decreased expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy provides evidence that mifepristone induces histological and subcellularchanges in decidua and chorionic villi. Mifepristone modulates the relative ratioof Bax/Bcl-2 and the increased apoptosis contributes to the pregnancy terminationat early stage of pregnancy.

AB  - Diffuse large B cell lymphoma comprises a heterogeneous group of B cell-derivedtumors, with different degrees of aggressiveness, as defined by their cellularorigin and tissue microenvironment. Using the spontaneous Bc.DLFL1 lymphomaoriginating from a BALB/c mouse as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma model, in thisstudy we demonstrate that the lymphoma cells display surface phenotype, IgHV-region somatic mutations, transcription factor characteristics and in vivolocation to splenic extrafollicular regions of age-associated B cells (ABCs),corresponding to T-bet(+) and Blimp-1(+)/CD138(-) plasmablasts derivation. Theexpansion of lymphoma cells within lymphoid tissues took place in a closearrangement with CD11c(+) dendritic cells, whereas the extranodal infiltrationoccurred selectively in the mesentery and omentum containing residentgp38/podoplanin(+) fibroblastic reticular cells. Antagonizing BAFF-R activity by mBR3-Fc soluble receptor fusion protein led to a significant delay of diseaseprogression. The extranodal expansion of Bc.DLFL1 lymphoma within the omental andmesenteric adipose tissues was coupled with a significant change of the tissuecytokine landscape, including both shared alterations and tissue-specificvariations. Our findings indicate that while Bc.DLFL1 cells of ABC origin retain the positioning pattern within lymphoid tissues of their physiologicalcounterpart, they also expand in non-lymphoid tissues in a BAFF-dependent manner,where they may alter the adipose tissue microenvironment to support theirextranodal growth.

AB  - A large number of behavioral experiments have demonstrated the existence of amagnetic sense in many animal species. Further, studies with immediate geneexpression markers have identified putative brain regions involved in magneticinformation processing. In contrast, very little is known about the physiology ofthe magnetic sense and how the magnetic field is neuronally encoded. In vivoelectrophysiological studies reporting neuronal correlates of the magnetic sense either have turned out to be irreproducible for lack of appropriate artifactcontrols or still await independent replication. Thus far, the research field of magnetoreception has little exploited the power of ex vivo physiological studies,which hold great promise for enabling stringent controls. However, tight spaceconstraints in a recording setup and the presence of magnetizable materials insetup components and microscope objectives make it demanding to generatewell-defined magnetic stimuli at the location of the biological specimen. Here,we present a solution based on a miniature vector magnetometer, a coil driver,and a calibration routine for the coil system to compensate for magneticdistortions in the setup. The magnetometer fits in common physiology recordingchambers and has a sufficiently small spatial integration area to allow forprobing spatial inhomogeneities. The coil-driver allows for the generation ofdefined non-stationary fast changing magnetic stimuli. Our ex vivo multielectrodearray recordings from avian retinal ganglion cells show that artifacts induced byrapid magnetic stimulus changes can mimic the waveform of biological spikes onsingle electrodes. However, induction artifacts can be separated clearly frombiological responses if the spatio-temporal characteristics of the artifact onmultiple electrodes is taken into account. We provide the complete hardwaredesign data and software resources for the integrated magnetic stimulationsystem.

AB  - In this Letter, we propose a new quantitative phase imaging methodology namedFourier optical spin splitting microscopy (FOSSM). FOSSM relies on a metasurface located at the Fourier plane of a polarized microscope to separate the objectimage into two replicas of opposite circularly polarized states. The biasretardation between the two replicas is tuned by translating the metasurface orrotating the analyzer. Combined with a polarized camera, FOSSM can easily achievesingle-shot quantitative phase gradient imaging, which greatly reduces thecomplexity of current phase microscope setups, paving the way for the nextgeneration high-speed real-time multifunctional microscopy.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the crystal structure ofbacteria-contaminated bovine dentin after Er:YAG laser irradiation at variousenergy densities from macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale. Background: Er:YAGlaser can change the morphology and chemical components of dentin. Fewpreliminary researchers investigate the laser effect on crystal in dentin tissue.Methods: Twenty dentin specimens from bovine incisors were cocultured with S.mutans (UA 159) and divided into four groups with diverse Er:YAG laserirradiation energy (0, 6.37, 12.73, 19.11 J/cm(2)). The ultrastructure of dentin before and after laser irradiation was investigated with nanoanalytical electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction provided the information of lattice parameters indentin. The morphology of dentin was observed by scanning electron microscopy.High-resolution transmission electron microscope images and selected-areaelectron diffraction patterns were obtained for characterizing crystal domainsize, structure, and microenvironment of dentin. Results: The combination ofthese methods disclosed that there exist mineralized, demineralized, andremineralized dentin in the bacteria-invaded dentin and can be feasiblyrecognized using morphological features. Laser treatments influencehydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals in dentin tissue in different ways: needle HAp inmineralized dentin tissue keeps intact with laser irradiation of no higher than19.11 J/cm(2); laser irradiation improves the crystallinity of lamella HAp bydomain growth and rearranges its growth orientations. Conclusions: We report anunprecedented presence of remineralization zone consisting of lamella HApcrystals with distinct high-index planes. These findings have broad implications on the role of laser operation in driving biomineralization and shed new insightsinto a possible relationship between laser irradiation and remineralization.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the pathological characteristics, treatment andprognosis of synovial sarcoma of head and neck. Methods: The clinical data of 24 patients with synovial sarcoma of the head and neck treated in the FirstAffiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2012 to December 2020were retrospectively analyzed. There were 16 males and eight females, aged 17 to 75 years. The pathological features, treatment and follow-up were summarized.Cumulative survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: All patients' diagnoses were confirmed by pathological examinations. Most cases showed thetumors were composed of spindle cells under microscope, with the characteristics of malignant tumor cells, and some tumors also showed epithelioid cellmorphology, forming the typical pathological characteristics of biphasicdifferentiation. Except for one patient who could not tolerate surgery and thediagnosis was only confirmed by biopsy, the remaining 23 patients receivedsurgical treatment, including three patients receiving surgical treatment alone, five patients receiving post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy, seven patientsreceiving post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy, and eight patients receivingpost-operative adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up time was 3.0-114.1 months (medianfollow-up time: 25.2 months), including two cases of loss to follow-up, 10 cases of recurrence, five cases of lung metastases, one case of bone metastasis, and 12cases of death. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates for the 24 patients with synovial sarcoma of head and neck were 74.4%, 58.9% and 39.2%, respectively.Conclusion: Synovial sarcoma of the head and neck has a high recurrence rate,common distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Histopathology andimmunohistochemical examinations are an important basis for diagnosis, ifnecessary, combined with molecular genetics. Surgical resection is the maintreatment, preferring radical or expanded resection.

PG  - 2702651
LID - 10.1155/2022/2702651 [doi]
AB  - Background: Urinary podocyte excretion is related to a reduction in glomerularpodocyte numbers, glomerulosclerosis, and urinary protein selectivity. Toelucidate the role of urinary podocytes in proteinuria and renal prognosis and toidentify the factors that cause podocyte detachment, we examined urinarypodocytes in 120 renal biopsy patients. Methods: Podocytes were identified inurinary sediments stained with fluorescent-labeled anti-podocalyxin antibodies inten high power fields. The amounts of protein bands, separated bySDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were calculated using an image softwareprogram and the correlation with urinary podocytes was analyzed. Podocyte surfacepores were observed using a low-vacuum scanning electron microscope. The renalprognosis, including induction of hemodialysis or 30% reduction in eGFR, wasinvestigated. Results: Urinary podocyte excretion showed a higher positivecorrelation with albumin excretion compared to IgG, prealbumin, and transferrin. There were no significant correlations between urinary podocyte count and lowmolecular weight proteins, including beta2-microglobulin andalpha1-microglobulin. The number of podocyte surface pores was positivelycorrelated with proteinuria, suggesting enhanced albumin transcytosis. Thehemodynamic pressure on the glomerular capillary wall, including products ofpulse pressure and pulse rate (water hammer pressure), was positively correlated with urinary podocyte excretion. Urinary podocyte excretion and Tamm-Horsfallprotein (THP) were independent risk factors for renal prognosis but were notrelated to response to treatment. Conclusion: Urinary podocyte excretion wascorrelated with urinary albumin excretion, indicating specific albumin transport by podocytes. Podocytes were detached from the glomerular capillaries by waterhammer pressure and THP was involved in the renal prognosis.

AB  - A new sensor for alogliptin benzoate (ALG) estimation based on a simple andsensitive method was evolved on multiwalled-carbon-nanotube modifiednanocrystalline zinc chromite carbon paste electrodes (ZnCr2O4@MWCNTs/CPEs). ALG electrochemical behavior was evaluated using a cyclic voltammetry (CV), squarewave voltammetry (SWV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The new electrode materialswere characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electronmicroscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) for elemental analysisand mapping, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) measurements. All these measurements exhibiting enhanced activity and high conductivity compared to the bare electrode without modification. The calibrationcurves obtained for ALG were in the ranges of 0.1-20 mumol L(-1) with aquantification and detection limits of 0.09 and 0.03 mumol L(-1), respectively.The prepared sensor showed a good sensitivity and selectivity with less overpotential for ALG determination. Finally, the presented method was successfullyapplied as a simple, precise and selective electrochemical electrode for theestimation of ALG in its pharmaceutical dosage form.

AB  - The utilization of plant essential oils (EOs) and nanomaterials due to theirsafety compared with synthetic chemicals has been considered in the management ofplant diseases. In this study, the inhibitory effects of Zataria multiflora,Nepeta haussknechtii, Artemisia sieberi, and Citrus aurantifolia EOs in pure and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanocapsulated formulations were evaluated on the mycelialgrowth of Alternaria solani to find a suitable alternative for syntheticchemicals. The crystal structure and morphological properties of the fabricatednanomaterials were assessed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) analyses. The textural features of the prepared nanoparticleswere investigated with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, and the presence ofelements in the samples was studied with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique.The mycelial growth inhibitory (MGI) was performed in the laboratory by mixingwith potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at concentrations of 100, 300, 600, 1,000,1,500, and 2,000 ppm. Based on the results, major differences were monitoredbetween different concentrations. At the highest studied concentration, theinhibition of Z. multiflora EO was 100%, which was 43.20, 42.37, and 21.19% forN. haussknechtii, A. sieberi, and C. aurantifolia, respectively, and theinhibition of their nanocapsules was 100, 51.32, 55.23, and 26.58%, respectively.In the greenhouse study, Z. multiflora EO and its nanocapsule (ZnO-ZmEO) werecompared with the ZnO and chlorothalonil fungicide based on the highestinhibitory of Z. multiflora in vitro. The highest antifungal effect was relatedto the ZnO-ZmEO by 53.33%. Therefore, the ZnO-ZmEO formulation can be recommendedas a biofungicide for managing and controlling tomato early blight disease after further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The segmentation of 3D cell nuclei is essential in many tasks, suchas targeted molecular radiotherapies (MRT) for metastatic tumours, toxicityscreening, and the observation of proliferating cells. In recent years, onepopular method for automatic segmentation of nuclei has been deep learningenhanced marker-controlled watershed transform. In this method, convolutionalneural networks (CNNs) have been used to create nuclei masks and markers, and thewatershed algorithm for the instance segmentation. We studied whether this methodcould be improved for the segmentation of densely cultivated 3D nuclei viadeveloping multiple system configurations in which we studied the effect of edge emphasizing CNNs, and optimized H-minima transform for mask and markergeneration, respectively. RESULTS: The dataset used for training and evaluationconsisted of twelve in vitro cultivated densely packed 3D human carcinoma cellspheroids imaged using a confocal microscope. With this dataset, the evaluationwas performed using a cross-validation scheme. In addition, four independentdatasets were used for evaluation. The datasets were resampled near isotropic forour experiments. The baseline deep learning enhanced marker-controlled watershed obtained an average of 0.69 Panoptic Quality (PQ) and 0.66 Aggregated JaccardIndex (AJI) over the twelve spheroids. Using a system configuration, which wasotherwise the same but used 3D-based edge emphasizing CNNs and optimized H-minimatransform, the scores increased to 0.76 and 0.77, respectively. When using theindependent datasets for evaluation, the best performing system configuration wasshown to outperform or equal the baseline and a set of well-known cellsegmentation approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The use of edge emphasizing U-Nets andoptimized H-minima transform can improve the marker-controlled watershedtransform for segmentation of densely cultivated 3D cell nuclei. A novel dataset of twelve spheroids was introduced to the public.

TI  - Boosted photocatalytic effect of binary AgI/Ag2WO4 nanocatalyst: characterizationand kinetics study towards ceftriaxone photodegradation.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22100-1 [doi]
AB  - In modern chemistry, great interest has been paid to introducing outstandingphotocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants. Herein, a highly efficientbinary AgI/Ag2WO4 photocatalyst was prepared from AgI and Ag2WO4 nanoparticles(NPs) and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), electrochemical impedancespectroscopy (EIS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques. In theScherrer model, the average crystallite sizes of 34.9, 42.0, and 24.1 nm wereestimated for the AgI, Ag2WO4, and the binary catalyst, while the values were 91,13, and 85 nm by the Williamson-Hall model. FTIR confirmed the presence of W-O-W,O-W-O, Ag-I, and O-Ag-O bonds in the coupled material. DRS results showedabsorption edge wavelengths of 451, 462, and 495 nm (corresponding to the bandgap values of 2.75, 2.68, and 2.51 eV) for Ag2WO4, AgI, and AgI/Ag2WO4 catalyst, respectively. Synergistic photocatalytic activity of the coupled system wasachieved towards ceftriaxone (CTX) in an aqueous solution (about 33% 10 ppm CTXsolution was degraded without any optimization in the initial conditions of cataldose 0.3 g/L (Ag2WO4:AgI with mole ratio 1:2 and 30 min abrasion time), andirrad. time 45 min, CCTX). This boosted effect depended on the AgI:Ag2WO4 moleratio and grinding time for the mechanical preparation of the binary catalyst(optimums: mole ratio of 4:1 and time 30 min). The photodegradation kineticsobeyed the Hinshelwood model with the apparent first-order rate constant (k) of0.013 min(-1) (t1/2 = 53.30 min). Performing the COD on the photodegraded CTXsolutions got a Hinshelwood plot with a slope of 0.019 min(-1) (t1/2 = 36.5 min).

AB  - The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) induced by theoveruse of antibiotics has become a serious threat to public health. Heavy metalswill bring longer-term selection pressure to ARGs when the concentration of theirresidues is higher than that of antibiotics in environmental media. To explorethe potential roles of montmorillonite (Mt) in the emergence of ARGs underdivalent cadmium ion (Cd(2+)) stress, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was inducedcontinuously for 15 days under Cd(2+) gradient concentrations (16, 32, 64, 96,and 128 mugmL(-1)) with and without Mt. Subsequently, antibiotic resistancetesting, transcriptomics, transmission electron microscope, scanning electronmicroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared were conducted for analysis. Theresults of characterization analysis showed that Cd(2+)could enhance theexpression of resistance genes such as penicillin, tetracycline, macrolactone,and chloramphenicol in E. coli. Moreover, compared with Cd(2+), Mt-Cd couldinhibit the promotion of these resistances by alleviating the expressions ofgenes involved in cell wall/membrane, protein synthesis, transport systems,signal transduction, and energy supply processes. Therefore, the study promotedthe understanding of Cd(2+) in triggering bacterial antibiotic resistance andhighlighted a novel theme of clay's ability to mitigate ecological risk ofantibiotic resistance caused by heavy metals. KEY POINTS: * Montmorillonite (Mt) could inhibit the promotion of antibiotic resistances. * E. coli formed a unique resistance mechanism by interacting with Mt and Cd(2+). * Mt stimulated cellular signal transduction, cellular component, and energy supply.

AB  - Grifola frondosa (G. frondosa) is widely known for its anti-tumor potential,which has been demonstrated by numerous scientific researches. In this study, twowater soluble polysaccharide-protein complexes were extracted from G. frondosa at4 degrees C (GFG-4) and 100 degrees C (GFG-100) and purified. Compared withGFG-100, GFG-4 had a higher protein content and molecular weight. The mainmonosaccharides of GFG-4 and GFG-100 were rhamnose, glucose, and galactose, with an approximate ratio of 3.00: 1.00: 0.86 and 2.85: 1.00: 0.94, respectively. The Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that the two polysaccharide-protein complexes displayed characteristic functional groups of polysaccharides andproteins, and mainly contain pyranose ring with alpha-glycosidic linkage. Atomic force microscope images showed that both GFG-4 and GFG-100 exhibited straightchains, and GFG-4 possessed a relatively abundant fraction of branched chains.Intriguingly, GFG-4 showed a stronger antiproliferative activity against HepG2cells than GFG-100. The mechanisms were further investigated by quantitativereal-time PCR and western blot, it found that GFG-4 inhibited the proliferationof HepG2 cells mainly through the intrinsic activation of mitochondrial pathwayand the Fas/FasL-mediated Caspase-8/-3 pathway. Conclusively, G. frondosacold-water extracted polysaccharide-protein complexes could be used as afunctional food for preventing or treating hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - The monomer of soot fractal aggregate is usually considered to be sphere, but themonomer shapes are cube and hexagon by some transmission electron microscope(TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. In this paper, thefractal soot models of different monomer shapes (sphere, cube, ellipsoid,hexagonal prism) were established. And the optical properties of models arecalculated by discrete dipole approximation (DDA). After systematically comparingthe Muller matrix and optical cross section properties between the models, wefind that monomer deviation from sphericity does not necessarily lead to further decline of F22(pi)/F11(pi) even at shorter wavelengths. In other words, thenon-sphericity of monomers does not necessarily affect the non-sphericity ofwhole soot particle. This can provide some implication for lidar remote sensingobservation. However, other light scattering matrix elements can keep goodconsistency. The maximum deviation of extinction cross section of hexagonal prismmodel is 11.2%. The more the monomer shape deviates from the sphere, the more theoptical integral properties of the non-spherical monomer model deviates from the optical integral properties of sphere monomer model. Hence, the difference inoptical properties caused by different monomer shapes cannot be neglected whenthe monomer deviates significantly from a spherical shape. This work is helpfulto evaluate the optical properties of soot aggregates more precisely.

AB  - In this paper, a simple solvothermal synthesis method was proposed for thepreparation of metal organic framework/graphene oxide hybrid nanocomposite(UiO-67/GO). A series of UiO-67/GO composites were prepared by varying theaddition forms and amounts of GO, and the optimal synthesis conditions werescreened. The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR), transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), scanningelectron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS), water contactangles (CA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption capacity and theadsorption process of toluene were investigated by dynamic adsorption andadsorption kinetics, respectively. The results indicated that 67/GO-0.5% reached the maximum adsorption capacity (876 mg g(-1)), which far exceeded the otheradsorbents. Kinetic model and the Weber-Morris model correlated satisfactorily tothe experimental data. The improved adsorption performance was attributed to GO, which enhanced pi-pi interaction, promoted defect generation and provided moreadsorption sites. Finally, the excellent regeneration performance of theadsorbent was verified by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and cyclicadsorption-desorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption mechanism was furtherrevealed. Combined with the related adsorption experiments and the densityfunctional theory (DFT) analysis, the efficient removal of toluene by UiO-67/GOwas attributed to the cooperation of defects, pi-pi interaction and hydrogenbonding.

TI  - Single-Cell Analysis of the Antimicrobial and Bactericidal Activities of theAntimicrobial Peptide Magainin 2.
PG  - e0011422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00114-22 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) inhibit the proliferation of or kill bacterialcells. To measure these activities, several methods have been used, which provideonly the average value of many cells. Here, we report the development of a methodto examine the antimicrobial and bactericidal activities of AMPs at thesingle-cell level (i.e., single-cell analysis) and apply this strategy to examinethe interaction of an AMP, magainin 2 (Mag), with Escherichia coli cells. Usingthis method, we monitored the proliferation of single cells on agar in amicrochamber and measured the distribution of the number of cells in eachmicrocolony using optical microscopy. For method A, we incubated cells in thepresence of various concentrations of AMPs for 3 h. The fraction of microcoloniescontaining only a single cell, Psingle, increased with the Mag concentration and reached 1 at a specific concentration, which corresponded to the MIC. For method B, after the interaction of a cell suspension with an AMP for a specific time, analiquot was diluted to stop the interaction, and the proliferation of singlecells then was monitored after a 3-h incubation; this method permits thedefinition of Psingle(t), the fraction of dead cells after the interaction. Forthe interaction of Mag with E. coli cells, Psingle(t) increased with theinteraction time, reaching ~1 at 10 and 20 min for 25 and 13 muM Mag,respectively. Thus, these results indicate that a short interaction time between Mag and E. coli cells is sufficient to induce bacterial cell death. IMPORTANCE Toelucidate the activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against bacterial cells, it is important to estimate the interaction time that is sufficient to inducecell death. We have developed a method to examine the antimicrobial andbactericidal activities of AMPs at the single-cell level (i.e., single-cellanalysis). Using this method, we monitored the proliferation of single cells onagar in a microchamber and measured the distribution of the number of cells ineach microcolony using optical microscopy. We found that during the interactionof magainin 2 (Mag) with E. coli cells, the fraction of dead cells, Psingle(t),increased with the interaction time, rapidly reaching 1 (e.g., 10 min for 25 muM Mag). This result indicates that Mag induces cell death after a short time ofinteraction.

AB  - In the present study, the use of low-cost, highly efficient, eco-friendly, andabundantly available (in Kashmir region, J&K India) willow leaves from whichadsorbents like willow leaves powder (WLP) and willow leaves biochar (WLB) wereprepared, have been found to be efficient for malachite green (MG) dye removaland can be used as an alternative to the current expensive methods of removingthe same dye from an aqueous solution. The techniques like Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and carbon,hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur (CHNS) analyser were used to characterize the sampleswithout any chemical treatment. SEM of the adsorbents shows the presence ofdifferent sized pores, cracks, and crevices. FTIR and CHNS show functional groupsand elemental concentration, respectively. The effects of various experimentalparameters such as contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration,salt treatment, and pH were investigated and optimal experimental conditions wereobtained. It has been found that Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms were useful for describing the equilibrium of adsorption system. The equilibriumadsorption data in this research work was found to follow both Langmuir andFreundlich isotherm models and maximum monolayer capacity of WLP and WLB werefound to be 10.014 and 21.244 mg/g, respectively. The experimental data for both WLP and WLB followed pseudo-second-order kinetic model with R(2)= 0.999.Intraparticle diffusion model reveals that more than one mechanism influenced theadsorption process. Thermodynamic study concluded that the adsorption isspontaneous for both adsorbents but exothermic for WLP and is endothermic innature for WLB. Present exploration and comparison with other reported adsorbentsconcluded that, WLP and WLB may be useful as low-cost attractive option for theremoval of MG dye from aqueous solution and therefore, also from wastewatercontaining MG dye.

(Willow tree)leaves and its biochar as the adsorbents for the removal of malachite green dyefrom its aqueous solution.Both the adsorbents namely willow leaves powder (WLP)and willow leaves biochar (WLB) are rapid and highly efficient for MG dye removalhaving percentage removal more than 92.5%.For WLB adsorbent the percentageremoval crosses 98.5% by the addition of 0.2 g KCl and by increasing 40 degrees Ctemperatures.The adsorbents used in this research work are comparable with thehighly efficient low-cost adsorbents used for MG dye like rice husk, waterhyacinth, seaweed, etc. found in the literature.The adsorbents (WLP and WLB) wereused without chemical treatment having good removal efficiency, cheap, easyavailable, and their mode of preparation is simple.

TI  - Varying Viral Replication and Disease Profiles of H2N2 Influenza in Ferrets IsAssociated with Virus Isolate and Inoculation Route.
PG  - e0073222
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00732-22 [doi]
AB  - H2N2 influenza virus, the causative agent of the 1957 "Asian flu" pandemic, hasdisappeared from circulation. However, H2-influenza viruses are still circulatingin avian reservoirs. Combined with the waning of H2N2-specific immunity in thehuman population, there is a risk of reintroduction of H2N2 influenza virus.Vaccines could help in preventing a future pandemic, but to assess their efficacyanimal models are required. We therefore set out to expand the ferret model forH2N2 influenza disease by infecting ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with four different H2N2 viruses to investigate their influence on the severity ofdisease. The H2N2 viruses were collected either during the pandemic or near theend of H2N2 circulation and covered both clade I and clade II viruses. Infection of ferrets with the different viruses showed that viral replication, disease, andpathology differed markedly between virus isolates and infection routes.Intranasal inoculation induced a severe to mild rhinitis, depending on the virus isolate, and did not lead to lung infection or pathology. When administeredintratracheally, isolates that successfully replicated in the lower respiratorytract (LRT) induced a nonlethal disease that resembles that of a moderatepneumonia in humans. Differences in viral replication and disease between virusescould be associated with their binding preference for alpha2,3- andalpha2,6-sialic acid. The model presented here could facilitate the developmentof a new generation of H2N2 influenza vaccines. IMPORTANCE In 1957 the world was subjected to a pandemic caused by an influenza A virus of the subtype H2N2.Although the virus disappeared in 1968, H2 viruses continue to circulate in avianreservoirs. It is therefore possible that the H2N2 influenza virus will bereintroduced into the human population, which can lead to another pandemic. Theimpact of a new H2N2 influenza pandemic can be mitigated by vaccination. However,these vaccines first need to be developed and tested in animal models. Inpreparation for this, we expanded the ferret model to mimic the different facets of human H2N2 influenza infection and disease. This model can be used for thedevelopment and evaluation of new H2N2 influenza vaccines.

TI  - Environmental photochemistry with thiol- and silica-modified plasmonicnanocomposites: SERS sensing of municipal solid waste and tannery waste leachate from groundwater.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22058-0 [doi]
AB  - Mismanagement of obsolete solid waste generates a massive deteriorating effect onthe environment. There is a high level of open trash disposal contaminating itsneighboring water bodies. This despoliation trash causes an endangerment to theliving environment. The waste management act is to hinder harmful effects onhuman beings, animals, plants, and their natural environment through theprinciples of waste prevention, waste processing, and waste disposal.Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhances the hazardous chemical sensing of environmental pollutants. To vigorously focus on the leaching of a couple oflandfills in groundwater and surface water, an unusual combination of SERS-based poly vinyl thiol and silica-modified silver nanocomposites (PVT/SiO2@Ag NCs) was synthesized. The optical, crystalline, and structural properties of PVT/SiO2@AgNCs were described with UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffractometer(XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-rayanalysis (EDX). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is detected at 403 nm fromthe PVT/SiO2@Ag NPs. The average crystallite size of PVT/SiO2 @ Ag NCs isestimated using the Scherrer formula as 11 nm. The calculated specific surfacearea (SSA), strains, and dislocation densities demonstrate the improvedmechanical properties of the substrate. The well-separated spherical shape of NPsis also observed, and the composition of silica and sulfur element in addition ofAg was confirmed by EDAX. Negatively charged SiO2 were bound strongly with the SHgroup and Ag NPs through electrostatic interaction mechanism as S-Ag-O-Si-O-Ag-S.SERS sensitivity is demonstrated by the prepared nanoparticles using anenvironmentally ignored leachate of municipal solid waste (MSW) and tannery waste(TW) landfill. PVT/SiO2@Ag NCs has detected the presence of innards of MSWleachate viz., aromatic hydrocarbon, phenols, phthalates, and pesticide from the groundwater. Furthermore, the TW leachate compositions of benzenes, hydrocarbons,amines, and chromium VI were analytically identified. Also, the leaching of TWleachate was confirmed in the water samples referred. Hence, this study provides a novel SERS sensor of PVT/SiO2@Ag NCs in the tile to detect and analyzeenvironmentally ignored organic and inorganic compounds.

AB  - Progress in structural membrane biology has been significantly accelerated by theongoing 'Resolution Revolution' in cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Inparticular, structure determination by single particle analysis has evolved into the most powerful method for atomic model building of multisubunit membraneprotein complexes. This has created an ever increasing demand in cryo-EM machine time, which to satisfy is in need of new and affordable cryo electronmicroscopes. Here, we review our experience in using the JEOL CRYO ARM 200prototype for the structure determination by single particle analysis of threedifferent multisubunit membrane complexes: the Thermus thermophilus V-type ATPaseVO complex, the Thermosynechococcus elongatus photosystem I monomer and theflagellar motor LP-ring from Salmonella enterica.

AB  - Energy storage film is one of the most important energy storage materials, while the performance of commercial energy storage films currently cannot meet thegrowing industrial requirements. Hence, this work presents a h-BN/PVDF/h-BNsandwich composite structure film prepared by laminating a large area ofultrathin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), the existence of which was confirmed by using an optical microscope and elementalcomposition analysis based on scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.This film has an ultrahigh dielectric strength of 464.7 kV/mm and a dischargedenergy density of up to 19.256 J/cm(3), which is much larger than the commercial energy storage film biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) (<2.5 J/cm(3)).Although the thickness of the h-BN film is only 70 nm compared with that of PVDF (about 12 mum), the dielectric strength of the sandwich-structured film presents a great increase. It is because of the excellent insulation performance of theh-BN film that helps to resist the electron injection and migration under highelectric field, and then suppress the formation and growth of the breakdown path,leading to an improvement of the charge-discharge efficiency.

AB  - A new species of the genus Boleodorus, recovered from southern Iran, is describedand illustrated based upon morphological and molecular data. B. bushehrensis n.sp. is mainly characterized by having a wide and low cephalic region (which iscontinuous with the adjacent body), the oral aperture in a depression in sideview under a light microscope, four lines in the lateral field, weak metacorpuswith a vestigial-to-invisible valve, and short (26-38 mm long) hooked tail withrounded tip. The females are 334-464 mm long and have a spherical spermathecafilled with spheroid sperm; males have 11.5- to 12.0-mm-long spicules and weakly developed bursa. The new species has an annulated low cephalic region, four largecephalic papillae, and small crescent-shaped amphidial openings when observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Its morphological and morphometricdifferences with seven known species are discussed. The phylogeneticrelationships of the new species with other relevant genera and species have beenstudied using partial sequences of small and large subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU andLSU rDNA). In both the SSU and LSU phylogenies, the sequences of B. bushehrensis n. sp. and other Boleodorus spp. formed a clade. A second species, B. thylactus, when studied under SEM, has a raised, smooth cephalic region, four large cephalicpapillae, and oblique amphidial slits, with the oral opening in a depression.

TI  - Identification and quantification of common microplastics in table salts by amulti-technique-based analytical method.
LID - 10.1007/s00216-022-04226-w [doi]
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are considered as contaminants of emerging concern to theenvironment and our food chains in recent years. In this study, we presented amulti-technique-based analytical method for detection of MPs through acombination of microscope-FTIR (mu-FTIR) with pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) toachieve 3-dimensional (3D) information for the identification of polymer type,characterization of particle size and morphology, and quantification of MPs basedon both particle number and mass of plastics. Plastics that are commonly used anddisposed of, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS),polyethylene terephthalate (PET), poly vinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), were covered in this study. Sample extractionand separation procedures were optimized for these microplastics in table saltswhere good recoveries (> 75%) were achieved. To further enhance the detectionsensitivity in simultaneous quantification of multiple polymers in a sample, aserial dissolution approach with different solvents was developed for thedetection of all 7 types of plastics. The established sample preparation process and multi-technique-based analytical method were validated with polymer standardsin table salts, resulting in satisfactory qualification and quantification forall samples tested. A retail survey of MPs in table salts was conducted with the developed analytical method, revealing that MPs were present in all commercially available table salts. The total number of MP particles varied from 20 to 125particles/kg and the total mass contents of seven types of plastics ranged from30 to 530 microg/kg in table salts.

LID - 10.1038/s41596-022-00712-8 [doi]
AB  - Advances in tissue labeling and clearing methods include improvement of tissuetransparency, better preservation of fluorescence signal, compatibility withimmunostaining and large sample volumes. However, as existing methods share thecommon limitation that they can only be applied to human tissue slices, renderingintact human organs transparent remains a challenge. Here, we describeexperimental details of the small-micelle-mediated human organ efficient clearingand labeling (SHANEL) pipeline, which can be applied for cellular mapping ofintact human organs. We have successfully cleared multiple human organs,including kidney, pancreas, heart, lung, spleen and brain, as well as hard tissuelike skull. We also describe an advanced volumetric imaging system using acommercial light-sheet fluorescence microscope that can accommodate most humanorgans and a pipeline for whole-organ imaging and visualization. The completeexperimental process of labeling and clearing whole human organs takes months andthe analysis process takes several weeks, depending on the organ types and sizes.

AB  - Single-point Tenax extractions are a viable means of estimating bioaccessibility of hydrophobic organic contaminants in sediment, soil, and intestinal fluids. Oneadvantage of this extraction technique is that after thorough cleaning anddrying, Tenax beads can be reused in subsequent extractions with the assumptionthat no changes in bioaccessibility estimates will occur. This assumption ofreusability, however, has not been tested. Therefore, the objective of thecurrent study was to evaluate the reusability of Tenax beads by comparingbioaccessible polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations measured bydifferently aged Tenax beads. New Tenax beads (60-80 mesh) were aged through 24 hsingle-point Tenax extractions of clean sand 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 times.The aged Tenax was then used to extract 27 PCB congeners from laboratory spikedsediment and the bioaccessible PCB concentrations were compared. Despitesignificant effects of PCB congener (F26, 567 = 97.291, p = 2.00 x 10(-16)),Tenax age (F6, 567 = 14.735, p = 1.12 x 10(-15)), and the interaction of thesetwo terms (F156, 567 = 1.711, p = 4.79 x 10(-6)) on bioaccessible concentrations measured by Tenax, the significance was due to two PCB congeners that showedlarge variation during analytical quantification. For the remaining 25 congeners,no differences in bioaccessible PCB concentrations were found between differentlyaged Tenax, suggesting repeated use did not impact bioaccessible estimatesprovided by Tenax. Scanning electron microscope imaging revealed no significantchanges in the visible surface area of the Tenax beads after aging (F6, 203 =1.434, p = 0.203), suggesting no significant changes in the Tenax phase volumeresulting in consistent estimates of bioaccessibility through repeated use. Giventhe strong correlations between single-point Tenax extractable and tissueconcentrations, providing data to detail the reusability of Tenax in repeatedextractions further demonstrates the applicability of this extraction techniquein risk assessment.

AB  - We present the first report of parasitism by Sarcoptes scabiei (Linnaeus, 1758), in a sechuran fox "Lycalopex sechurae". Sarcoptes scabiei is a mite that producessarcoptic mange, which can lead to the death of the animal host and can causeepidemic episodes in wildlife communities. The sechuran fox was collected by the environmental police from a citizen who reported the animal. It was sent to aveterinarian specializing in wildlife, "Clinica Mansion Mascota", in Guayaquil,Ecuador. Immediate physical examination showed crusts on its skin, and samples ofskin and blood were collected and analyzed. The skin samples were analyzed using a microscope at 40x magnification in the clinic. In addition, skin and bloodsamples were sent to a private laboratory for further analyses. Both analyseswere positive for S. scabiei infection. It is the second report of S. scabiei in a new wildlife species in the Guayas province of Ecuador within less than a year.These events cause concern due the possibility of biological communitytransmission. Since domestic and feral animals are considered habitual spreaders of this disease, management through ethical procedures such as adoption, medical treatment and neutering campaigns, and awareness-raising projects with empatheticapproach are recommended.

AB  - Controlling selectivity of reactions is an ongoing quest in chemistry. In thiswork, we demonstrate reversible and selective bond formation and dissociationpromoted by tip-induced reduction-oxidation reactions on a surface. Molecularrearrangements leading to different constitutional isomers are selected by thepolarity and magnitude of applied voltage pulses from the tip of a combinedscanning tunneling and atomic force microscope. Characterization of voltagedependence of the reactions and determination of reaction rates demonstrateselectivity in constitutional isomerization reactions and provide insight intothe underlying mechanisms. With support of density functional theorycalculations, we find that the energy landscape of the isomers in differentcharge states is important to rationalize the selectivity. Tip-induced selective single-molecule reactions increase our understanding of redox chemistry and couldlead to novel molecular machines.

TI  - First Report of Rhizopus arrhizus (syn. R. oryzae) Causing Garlic Bulb Soft Rotin Hebei Province, China.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-22-1024-PDN [doi]
AB  - Rhizopus soft rot occurs on the succulent tissues of vegetables, fruits, andornamental plants throughout the world (Cui et al. 2019). When the garlic is inthe seedling stage in the fields (Fig. S1) in November 2021, a disease outbreakon garlic bulbs suspected as Rhizopus soft rot occurred in Daming County, Handan City, Hebei Province of China (N 36 degrees 17', E 115 degrees 13'). This diseasesymptom was first found in the garlic seedling stage in China. Disease incidence was 10% to 30% in cultivated garlic bulbs. There were soft water-soaked lesionson the surface of diseased garlic bulbs and the interiors were brown and soft. Inthe disease severe field, white to gray mycelia were observed on the diseasedgarlic bulbs. Infected garlic bulbs were sampled to isolate and determine theidentity of the disease-causing organism. Symptomatic bulbs were surfacesterilized with 1% NaClO for 2 min, dipped in 75% ethanol for 3 min and rinsedthree times with autoclaved distilled water. Small pieces of the inner decayedtissue were removed and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28 degrees Cfor 2 to 3 days. Five white colonies grew on PDA and then they became brownishgray to blackish-gray mycelium. The fungal strains were purified by hyphal-tipisolation method. To determine the identity of the five isolated fungi, weanalyzed their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences (Jung et al.2012). BLAST analysis of the ITS sequences from DSF-0-2 (accession no. ON706022),DSF-0-3 (accession no. ON706021), DSF-0-4 (accession no. ON706020), DSF-0-5(accession no. ON706019) and DSF-0-6 (accession no. ON706018) were all 100%identical with Rhizopus arrhizus (syn. Rhizopus oryzae). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA11 based on the sequences ofITS rRNA gene (Walther et al. 2013). Phylogenetic trees indicated that isolateswere most likely Rhizopus arrhizus (syn. Rhizopus oryzae) (Fig. S2). We selected one isolated strain, DSF-0-2, for characterize the morphology and test itsability to cause garlic bulb soft rot. Under the microscope, nonseptate rhizoids,sporangia, and sporangiospores were observed (Fig. S1). Sporangiospores wereunequal, subglobose, numerous irregular, or oval, and 9.7 (6.2 - 12.5) x 6.5 (4.1- 8.5) mum (n = 50) in diameter. The sporangia were globose, black, 121.5 (65 -198) mum (n = 50) in diameter. Based on the rDNA-ITS sequencing and themorphological characteristics, the DSF-0-2 isolate was identified as Rhizopusarrhizus (syn. Rhizopus oryzae) (Zheng et al. 2007; Abeywickrama et al. 2020). Tocomplete Koch's postulates, surface-sterilized healthy garlic bulbs wereinoculated with R. arrhizus isolate DSF-0-2. A 1.0-ml sterile syringe was used toinject 50 mul of a 106 conidia/ml suspension into each of five healthy bulbs. As a control, garlic bulbs were treated with sterile distilled water. The inoculatedand control bulbs were incubated at 28 degrees C for 7 days. The bulbs inoculatedwith R. arrhizus DSF-0-2 showed symptoms of water soaking, and the tissues werebrown and soft throughout the bulb at 7 days (Fig. S1). Results of the threetrials were the same. No symptoms were observed in the control group. R. arrhizuswas reisolated from the symptomatic garlic bulb and confirmed as such based-oncolony and sporangia morphology and ITS sequence. There were some reports that R.arrhizus infects cassava tubers and potato tubers (Amadioha and Markson 2007; Cuiet al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. arrhizus (syn.Rhizopus oryzae) associated with soft rot on garlic bulb in the seedling stage inChina. This disease has posed a potential threat during garlic seedling stage in the field. Management measures should be considered before this disease outbreakswidely. Garlic bulbs died in the seedling stage, which caused productionreduction, serious economic loss and soil pollution. This finding may help totake effective control measures for this disease.

LID - 10.1007/s10123-022-00265-6 [doi]
AB  - Bjerkandera adusta can decompose polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons includingcellulose and lignin, but its roles in inhibiting plant pathogens are unclear.Here, the confrontation culture and greenhouse pot experiments were employed tostudy the control effect of B. adusta M1 on Fusarium graminearum and wheat scab. The results showed that B. adusta M1 fermentation broth (FB) inhibited the growthof F. graminearum, with an inhibition rate of 52.7-89.17%. FB had a significantcontrol effect (72.14 +/- 1.42%) on wheat scab, which was slightly lower thanthat of the chemical fungicide carbendazim (77.34 +/- 1.76%). The growth rate wassignificantly higher in B. adusta M1 than in F. graminearum, indicating a strong competitiveness by B. adusta M1. The images from a scanning electron microscopeshowed substantial deformations of the hyphae of F. graminearum being penetrated by the hyphae of B. adusta M1, indicating a strong mycoparasitism by B. adustaM1. In addition, FB increased the activity of catalase, peroxidase, andphenylalanine ammonia-lyase in wheat leaves related to disease resistance anddecreased the malondialdehyde production and cell membrane permeability. Weconclude that B. adusta M1 is a promising fungal agent to control the detrimentof F. graminearum to cereal growth in the field.

TI  - Detection and Typing of Renal Amyloidosis by Fluorescence Spectroscopy Using the Environmentally Sensitive Fluorophore K114.
LID - 10.1007/s11307-022-01754-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate that spectral analysis using the K114 fluorophore candetect and differentiate AL and AA renal amyloidosis. PROCEDURES: Kidney biopsiesfrom patients with AL amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis, and normal samples with noevident pathology were stained with Congo Red and K114. The specimens were imagedon a spectral confocal microscope. RESULTS: Congo Red displayed homogeneousspectra across the three tissue types while K114 chromatically distinguishedbetween normal tissue, AL amyloid, and AA amyloid. Additionally, Congo Reddisplayed an increased risk of false positive staining compared to K114. Spectralphasors computed from K114-stained tissue sections quantitatively differentiated the three tissue types. K114-stained amyloid deposits displayed a significantlygreater increase in brightness after 50 images acquired in rapid successioncompared to normal tissue. Quantitative analysis of intensity changes in thebackground of diseased tissue also differentiated AL and AA amyloid samples,suggesting widespread amyloid deposition. Both amyloid and the backgrounds ofdiseased samples red-shifted while normal tissue blue-shifted in response torepeated imaging, supporting this theory. CONCLUSIONS: K114 staining of renalbiopsies is a promising technique to detect and differentiate types of renalamyloidosis. Due to the advantages this method has over traditional Congo Redstaining, the techniques presented here warrant further development for potentialuse in clinical settings.

AB  - Loess features metastable microstructure and is deemed susceptible to chemicalcontaminant permeation. However, studies on the loess permeability evolutionunder water and chemical environments are remarkably limited. In this study, the response of the loess to the water and sodium sulfate seepages was analyzed usingthe temporal relationship of cations concentration, X-ray diffraction andfluorescence (XRD and XRF), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and scanningelectron microscope (SEM) tests. The permeability evolution characteristics were identified, and its underlying mechanisms were revealed from aspects of thediffuse double layer (DDL) theory and physiochemical actions. The discharge ofMg(2+) and precipitation of calcium carbonate, referred also to as thededolomitization, degraded the macro permeability when subjected to the waterseepage test. The salt-induced swelling, induced by the intrusion of Na(+) intothe DDL, caused an increase in the micropore fraction under the sodium sulfateseepage test, thereby increasing the macro permeability.

PG  - e09926
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09926 [doi]
AB  - The conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have many side effects due to theirnon-selective tissue distribution, reduced drug concentration of the drug at the tumor site, and the drug resistance. To overcome these problems thechemotherapeutic agent should selectively accumulate the tumor site and staysthere for a prolonged period of time releasing the payloads in a controlledmanner. This can be achieved by the administration of a smart drug deliverysystem (SDDS) loaded with the active drug molecules. In this work, 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) is loaded into amine functionalised hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles(HMSN-NH2) and then coated with a biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) to formulateSSDS for 5-FU for pH-sensitive drug release. The physiochemical properties werecharacterised; the structural morphology was observed by using opticalmicroscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope,chemical interaction between the drug and excipients were characterised fromFourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the entrapment efficiency of loaded drugand the pH-dependent drug release rate were evaluated using UV-visiblespectroscopy. It was observed that, the drug is compatible with excipients byretaining all the characteristics peaks of 5-FU with negligible changes in theposition in all physical mixtures. The PDA coated 5-FU loaded HMSN-NH2 alsoexhibits a nearly spherical and non-aggregated morphology. The release rate wasshowed to increase with increase in concentration of structure-directing agent(Triton X 100) in the rate of a maximum release at the end of 72 h in pH 4. Theprepared novel PDA coated 5-FU HMSN-NH2 was found to be capable of delivering theanti-cancer drug 5-FU specifically at the tumor site in a pH-dependentstimuli-responsive manner. It also showed a controlled release for a period of 72h. The enhanced cytotoxicity against HeLa cell line were found for the formulatedSSD form.

In recentyears, JB reportedly displayed anti-tumor activity in solid tumors, such asbreast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. In this study, we evaluatedthe effect of JB on HeLa cells with a focus on cell growth inhibition and relatedmechanisms. HeLa cells were cultured in vitro and divided into a blank controlgroup, HeLa-Scramble (0, 0.25, 0.5 mM), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) protein silenced group, HeLa-shWASH (0, 0.25, 0.5 mM).Morphological changes were observed using an inverted microscope. The inhibition rate of cell proliferation was detected using the WST-1 method. Flow cytometryBrdu+PI double standard method was used to detect cell replication ability andFITC+PI double standard method was used to detect cell apoptosis rate. Westernblot was used to verify the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, WASH, Bax, Bcl-2, and PCNA.The mRNA expression of cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, and IL-8) was detected usingRT-qPCR. The results showed that JB induced cell apoptosis and arrested cells at the G2/M phase in HeLa-shWASH cells compared with HeLa-Scramble cells (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). In addition, JB upregulated IL-1alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 inHeLa-shWASH cells. We conclude that WASH protein participates in JB-inducedregulation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, aggravates inflammatory responses, andpromotes cancer cell apoptosis, thus inhibiting the proliferation and invasionabilities of HeLa cells. JB may have anti-tumor effects and potential clinicalvalue for the treatment of cervical cancer.

AB  - Purpose: Investigate the effect of low nanodiamond (ND) addition and autoclavepolymerization on the flexural strength, impact strength, and hardness ofpolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) denture base. Methods: A total of 240 heatpolymerized PMMA were fabricated with low ND concentrations of 0.1%, 0.25%, and0.5%, and unmodified as control. The specimens were divided equally into group I:conventionally polymerized PMMA by water bath and group II: polymerized by theautoclave. The impact strength, flexural strength, and elastic modulus weretested using the Charpy-type impact-testing machine and three-point bending test,respectively. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to analyze thefractured surfaces. Surface hardness was measured by a hardness tester with aVickers diamond. The bonding and interaction between the PMMA and ND particleswere analyzed by the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscope. ANOVA andpost hoc Tukey test were used for data analysis (alpha = 0.05). Results: NDaddition significantly increased the flexural strength of groups I and II (p <0.001, p=0.003); it was highest (128.8 MPa) at 0.25% ND concentration for group Iand at 0.1% for group II. Elastic modulus increased at 0.1% ND for both groups(p=0.004, p=0.373), but the increase was statistically significant for group Ionly. Impact strength showed no significant change with the addition of ND ingroups I and II (p=0.227, p=0.273), as well as surface hardness in group I(p=0.143). Hardness decreased significantly with 0.25%ND in group II. Conclusion:The addition of ND at low concentration increased the elastic modulus andflexural strength of conventionally and autoclave polymerized denture base resin.Autoclave polymerization significantly increased the flexural strength, impactstrength, and hardness of unmodified PMMA and hardness of 0.5% ND group.

TI  - Determination of E-modulus of cancellous bone derived from human humeri andvalidation of plotted single trabeculae: Development of a standardized humerusbone model.
PG  - 48-54
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2022.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Background: Evaluation of the mechanical behavior of the microstructure ofcancellous bone seems important for the understanding of the mechanical behavior of bone. Prevention and treatment of fragility fractures due to osteoporosis is amajor challenge according to ageing population. A bone model might help to assessfracture risk. Measurement of single trabeculae of bone should give furtherinformation compared with bone densitometry alone. This study measures themechanical properties of single cancellous trabeculae derived from human proximalhumerus. Methods: 34 single trabeculae dissected from human humeral heads weremeasured and evaluated mechanically. Trabeculae were fixed on microscope slidesand geometrical data were reported during axial rotation of the specimens tomeasure the transverse section using computer aided design (CAD). The sampleswere subjected to a two-point bending test and were loaded with a measure-stampat a defined distance. Force and deflection were measured by high-resolutionsensors. The E-modulus was then calculated in combination with finite elementsmethod simulation (FEM), using the previously obtained CAD-Data. Results: Theaverage E-modulus from 34 valid measurements of human humeral trabeculae was 1678MPa with a range from 829 to 3396 MPa, which is consistent with existingliterature. The planned additional validation of the measurement method usingmanufactured three-dimensional synthetic trabeculae with known mechanicalproperties showed an average elastic modulus of single trabeculae of 51.5 MPa,being two dimensions lower than the value reported in the datasheet of theplastic. Conclusion: This newly developed, time and cost-efficient procedureallows the measurement of E-modulus in single trabeculae. Measurement of mechanicparameters of single trabeculae might give insights on mechanic behavior of bone and be relevant for the research of systemic bone diseases, complementing theexisting data on bone-mineral-density. Further examination of single trabeculaeof human cancellous bone should give an insight on the mechanical behavior ofbone also considering systemic bone diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robotic technology is increasingly used in neurosurgery. The authors reported a new technique for fence-post tube placement using robot-guidedframeless stereotaxic technology with neuronavigation in patients with glioma.OBSERVATIONS: Surgery was performed using the StealthStation S8 linked to theStealth Autoguide cranial robotic guidance platform and a high-resolutionthree-dimensional (3D) surgical microscope. A surgical plan was created todetermine the removal area using fence-post tube placement at the tumor andnormal brain tissue boundary. Using this surgical plan, the robotic systemallowed quick and accurate fence-post tube positioning, automatic alignment ofthe needle insertion and measurement positions in the brain, and quick andaccurate puncture needle insertion into the brain tumor. Use of a ventriculardrainage tube for the outer needle cylinder allowed placement of the punctureneedle in a single operation. Furthermore, use of a high-resolution 3D exoscopeallowed the surgeon to simultaneously view the surgical field image and thenavigation screen with minimal line-of-sight movement, which improved operativesafety. The position memory function of the 3D exoscope allowed easy switchingbetween the exoscope and the microscope and optimal field of view adjustment.LESSONS: Fence-post tube placement using robot-guided frameless stereotaxictechnology, neuronavigation, and an exoscope allows precise glioma resection.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of the application of data acquisition in the newnanometer drug delivery system of microscope, a research of antigallbladdercarcinoma activity analysis was proposed. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a commonmalignant tumor in biliary tract diseases. Due to the lack of specific clinicalmanifestations in the early stage, GBC has the shortcomings of the hidden onset, the difficult diagnosis, and the high misdiagnosis rate. GBC ranks in the topposition among the most common tumors of the digestive system worldwide. Thepreoperative diagnosis rate is low, and the incidence of accidental gallbladdercarcinoma is gradually increasing. Domestic gallbladder carcinoma related tocholecystectomy is not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgicalresection is still the only effective method for the treatment of accidentalgallbladder carcinoma.

AB  - To address the question of determining the osteogenic differentiation ofmesenchymal stem cells, the bone marrow studies were performed using probemicroscopy. All adherent bone marrow was used to isolate the bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells and expanded and purified in vitro. Its morphology underan inverted microscope was observed. We used Zuogui Pills to differentiate theseparation methods. Alcian blue staining, modified calcium cobalt alkalinephosphatase staining, and neuron-specific enolase immunohistochemical stainingwere performed. The experimental results are shown below. The morphology of theisolated and purified cells was analyzed with an inverted microscope, and theisolated and purified cells were analyzed with Zuogui Pill. Alcian blue staining,modified calcium cobalt alkaline phosphatase staining, and neuron-specificenolase immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the cells differentiated intocartilage and osteoblasts, and the cell structure and morphology were similar to those of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The results showed that theadherent mode of cells obtained from the whole bone marrow was the rat bonemarrow mesenchymal stem cells, and the Zuogui Pills could induce multidirectionaldifferences in the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

AB  - Gingival fibroblasts play an important role in the constitution of soft tissueattachment. This study aims to investigate whether porous zirconia coating has a positive effect on promoting human gingival fibroblast attachment. The porouszirconia coating was loaded on zirconia surface by the dip coating method,surface morphology and composition were confirmed by scanning electron microscopeand energy dispersive spectrometer; Tested the tensile bond strength by universaltesting machine; Tested the surface roughness by roughness analyzer; Humangingival fibroblast proliferation, integrin beta1 and F-actin immunofluorescence staining explored the influence of porous zirconia on the adhesion andproliferation of human gingival fibroblast. Zirconia0.2 group showed sphericalzirconia particles with diameters of 3-8 mum are distributed on the surface; The bonding strength of zirconia particle coating group reached 16.1+/-0.1 MPa, andthe surface roughness was 0.715+/-0.091 mum; In comparison with control group (P < 0.01), the percentage of human gingival fibroblasts adhering to zirconia wasmarkedly higher. In zirconia group, integrin-beta1 and F-actin fluoresced moreobvious than in control group. Porous zirconia coating can form a porousstructure on the surface and the porous structure can promote the attachment and proliferation of human gingival fibroblast, it will be more beneficial for softtissue early sealing.

TI  - Involvement of membrane palmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2) in the synaptic molecular complex at the mouse cerebellar glomerulus.
LID - 10.1007/s00418-022-02137-6 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that the membrane skeletal protein 4.1G in the peripheral nervous system transports membrane palmitoylated protein 6 (MPP6), whichinteracts with the synaptic scaffolding protein Lin7 and cell adhesion molecule 4(CADM4) in Schwann cells that form myelin. In the present study, we investigated the localization of and proteins related to MPP2, a highly homologous familyprotein of MPP6, in the cerebellum of the mouse central nervous system, in which neurons are well organized. Immunostaining for MPP2 was observed at cerebellarglomeruli (CG) in the granular layer after postnatal day 14. Using thehigh-resolution Airyscan mode of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, MPP2 wasdetected as a dot pattern and colocalized with CADM1 and Lin7, recognized assmall ring/line patterns, as well as with calcium/calmodulin-dependent serineprotein kinase (CASK), NMDA glutamate receptor 1 (GluN1), and M-cadherin,recognized as dot patterns, indicating the localization of MPP2 in the excitatorypostsynaptic region and adherens junctions of granule cells. Animmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MPP2 formed a molecular complex withCADM1, CASK, M-cadherin, and Lin7. Furthermore, the Lin7 staining pattern showed small rings surrounding mossy fibers in wild-type CG, while it changed to thedot/spot pattern inside small rings detected with CADM1 staining inMPP2-deficient CG. These results indicate that MPP2 influences the distributionof Lin7 to synaptic cell membranes at postsynaptic regions in granule cells atCG, at which electric signals enter the cerebellum.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of Wenyang Zhenshuai granules (WZG) onthe morphology of cardiomyocytes, cell viability, and the expression of keymitochondrial autophagy proteins in the doxorubicin-induced model of H9c2cardiomyocyte injury. Cardiomyocytes were cultured for 44 h and divided into 4groups: intact control, doxorubicin-injured cells (DOX), doxorubicin-injuredcells treated with WZG (DOX+WZG), and doxorubicin-injured cells treated withvalsartan (DOX+valsartan; reference group). The morphology of cardiomyocytes was analyzed under an inverted microscope; cardiomyocyte survival rate was determinedby MTT assay. The expression of the key mitochondrial autophagy proteins (PINK1, parkin, LC3-II, and prohibitin-2) was analyzed by Western blotting. WZGdown-regulated the expression of the key mitochondrial autophagy proteins inDOX-injured cells, which may be one of the important mechanisms for regulatingventricular remodeling and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

TI  - PDA modification and properties of alpha-AlH3.
PG  - 12348
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16424-8 [doi]
AB  - We present a novel surface coating to resolve the stability of alpha-AlH3.Inspired by the strong chemical adhesion of mussels, the polymerization ofdopamine was first introduced to coat alpha-AlH3 through simple situpolymerization. The alpha-AlH3 was used as a substrate. In-depthcharacterizations confirmed the formation of polydopamine (PDA) on the alpha-AlH3surface. The coated alpha-AlH3 sample was characterized by X-ray diffractionX-ray photoelectron spectrometry and Scanning Electron Microscope. The resultsshow that a strong PDA film is formed on the surface of alpha-AlH3, andPDA@alpha-AlH3 retains its primary morphology. The crystal form of alpha-AlH3does not change after coating with PDA. The XPS analysis results show that N1 sappears on the material after coating with PDA, indicating that polydopamine isformed on the surface of alpha-AlH3. The moisture absorption tests show that the moisture absorption rate of alpha-AlH3 is greatly reduced after being coated withPDA. The excellent intact ability of PDA prevents alpha-AlH3 from reacting withwater in air. The thermal stability of alpha-AlH3 before and after coating wasanalyzed by DSC. This work demonstrates the successful applications of dopaminechemistry to alpha-AlH3, thereby providing a potential method for metastablematerials.

LID - 10.1109/TNB.2022.3192491 [doi]
AB  - The article describes the development of a hetro-core optical fiber sensorstructure based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) for the detectionof cardiac troponin I (cTnI) solution. This was accomplished by fabricating asingle-mode fiber - multimode fiber - single-mode fiber (SMS) structure. Then,fiber structure is immobilized with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and cerium oxidenanoparticles (CeO2-NPs) to improve its sensing capabilities. An UV-Visspectrophotometer and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM)are used to determine the morphology of synthesized nanoparticles. Scanningelectron microscopy (SEM) is used to examine the state of immobilized NPs on the surface of sensing region. The developed sensor probe has a linear range of 0 to 1000 ng/mL cTnI, a sensitivity of 3 pm/(ng/mL), and a limit of detection (LoD) of108.15 ng/mL. In real time, the proposed sensor will be used in a practice todetect acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

TI  - Evaluation of a diagnostic algorithm for rapid identification of Gram-negativespecies and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemasedirectly from blood cultures.
LID - dkac230 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac230 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a rapid diagnostic algorithm based on MALDI-TOF MS,lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) and molecular testing performed directly frompositive blood cultures (BCs) for Gram-negative species identification anddetection of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and main carbapenemases.METHODS: Non-duplicate BCs positive to Gram-negative bacteria at microscopeexamination were subjected to species identification by direct MALDI-TOF MSfollowing recovery of bacterial pellet by Rapid MBT Sepsityper(R) kit.Subsequently, NG-Test(R) CARBA 5 and NG-Test(R) CTX-M MULTI LFIAs were performed according to identified microbial species. Eazyplex(R) SuperBug CRE molecularassay was performed in cases of NG-Test(R) CARBA 5 negative results in patientswith documented carbapenemase-producers carriage. Results of rapid diagnosticworkflow were compared with those obtained by conventional diagnostic routine.RESULTS: Overall, the direct MALDI-TOF MS protocol allowed reliableidentification to the species level of 92.1% of the 2133 monomicrobial BCs. Rate of matched identification was significantly higher for Enterobacterales (97.3%)in comparison to non-fermenting Gram-negative species (80.2%), obligate anaerobicbacteria (42.1%) and fastidious Gram-negative species (41.5%). The overallsensitivity of NG-Test(R) CARBA 5 and NG-Test(R) CTX-M MULTI was 92.2% and 91.6%,respectively. Integration of Easyplex(R) SuperBug CRE allowed the detection ofblaKPC mutants associated with ceftazidime/avibactam resistance, reaching 100%sensitivity in carbapenemase detection. Both LFIAs and molecular testing showedno false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms based on MALDI-TOF MS, LFIAsand molecular testing may represent a cost-effective tool to timely identifyGram-negative species and detect resistance markers directly from BCs. According to local epidemiology, these results may allow antimicrobial stewardshipinterventions including prompt use of new approved drugs.

TI  - Study on luminescent properties of orange phosphor NaCaPO4 :Eu(3).
LID - 10.1002/bio.4341 [doi]
AB  - The NaCaPO4 :Eu(3+) phosphor was synthesized by the sol-gel method. Thestructure, luminescence properties of phosphors were analyzed byThermogravimetric-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA), infrared spectrum (IR),X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and fluorescence spectrum. TG-DTA results show that NaCaPO4 phase can be formed after 700 degrees C. FT-IR spectra confirmed the existence of PO4 units. XRD results show that the sample is pure NaCaPO4 orthorhombic crystal phase. The TEM diagram shows that thesample shows good uniformity. The NaCaPO4 :Eu(3+) emits orange light under 394 nmexcitation. The optimal doping concentration is 3 mol%. The reason ofconcentration quenching caused by the multipolar interaction. Through furtheranalysis of the charge transfer band and the spectrum at (5) D0 -->(7) F0transition of the NaCaPO4 :Eu(3+) phosphor, the reason for the orange light ofthe phosphor due to the different Eu(3+) occupancy is explained in detail.

AB  - Implantation of biomaterials capable of the controlled release of antibacterials during articular cartilage repair may prevent postoperative infections. Herein,biomaterials are prepared with biomimetic architectures (nonwoven mats of fibers)via electrospinning that are composed of poly(varepsilon-caprolactone),poly(lactic acid), and Bombyx mori silk fibroin (with varying ratios) and,optionally, an antibiotic drug (cefixime trihydrate). The composition,morphology, and mechanical properties of the nanofibrous mats are characterizedusing scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and tensile testing. The nonwoven mats have nanoscale fibers (typical diameters of324-725 nm) and are capable of controlling the release profiles of the drug, withantibacterial activity against Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacteria (two common strainsof human pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) underin vitro static conditions. The drug loaded nanofiber mats displaycytocompatibility comparable to pure poly(varepsilon-caprolactone) nanofiberswhen cultured with National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH-3T3 fibroblast cellline and have long-term potential for clinical applications in the field ofpharmaceutical sciences.

AB  - Following the preparation of Acanthopanax senticosus total saponinsmicroemulsion, the formulation and preparation technology were optimized and the quality was evaluated. The absorption characteristics of A. senticosus totalsaponins microemulsion by the self-microemulsifying drug delivery system(SMEDDS) were investigated in the unidirectional intestinal perfusion model in vivo. Theoil phase, mass ratio(K_m), number of revolutions, and drug concentration weresubjected to single-factor investigation with the area of pseudo-ternary phasediagram as the index. The process was optimized by D-optimal mixture design with the particle size as the index, and then the appearance, morphology, and particlesize were investigated. The mass concentrations of eleutherosides B and E in the microemulsion were determined. The results showed that the optimum formulation ofA. senticosus total saponins microemulsion was determined as follows: 20.8% ofwater phase, 31.2% of isopropyl palmitate, and 48.0% of soybean phospholipid and absolute ethanol(K_m=1ratio1). As revealed by the observation under atransmission electron microscope, the microemulsion exhibited homogeneousdispersion and was a spherical emulsion droplet in the water-in-oil type. At roomtemperature, the pH value was 5.19, the refractive index 1.416 5, the averageparticle size(26.47+/-0.04)nm, and the polydispersity index(PDI) 0.118+/-0.03.The content of the eleutherosides B and E was 0.038 9 and 0.166 4 mg.mL~(-1),respectively. The preliminary stability study showed that the solution was clear and transparent within 30 d, without stratification or content change, indicatinggood stability. The absorption of microemulsion in each intestinal segment wassignificantly improved as compared with that of the A. senticosus total saponins,with the best absorption effect detected in the ileum, which has laid afoundation for further development and utilization of A. senticosus.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Interim restorations are often used along with mouth rinsesduring the healing period following surgical procedures. However, evidenceregarding the color and surface properties of digitally fabricated interimrestorations after oral rinsing is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitrostudy was to evaluate whether different mouth rinses could affect the color andsurface roughness of milled and printed interim restorations after simulated oralrinsing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disk-shaped specimens (O15x2 mm; N=180) werefabricated by using conventional (Jet Tooth Shade), milled (Yamahachi PMMA Disk),and printed (NextDent C&B) resin materials. All resin specimens were divided into3 different groups according to the rinsing material: distilled water, whitening mouth rinse (Listerine Healthy White), and conventional mouth rinse (ListerineCool Mint). The specimens were further allocated into short- and long-termsubgroups, and oral rinsing simulation was performed (n=10). Short-term rinsingsimulated the conditions in a usual interim restoration period, and long-termrinsing was performed to evaluate the properties of the interim materials. Thecolor differences (CIEDE2000, DeltaE00) between the baseline and each time point were determined by using a spectrophotometer. The surface roughness of the testedspecimens was measured by using a confocal laser scanning microscope.Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests with nonparametric pairwise comparisons wereused to analyze the data (alpha=.05). RESULTS: On simulation of a 6-month use of the mouth rinse, the color change in the milled resin did not differ from that inthe conventional resin (P>.334), but the printed resin showed a significantlygreater color change than the other resins (P<.007). The greatest color changewith the printed resin was observed when a conventional mouth rinse was used.However, all color changes were below a perceptible threshold of 1.30. When dailyrinsing for 14 years was simulated, all resin groups showed a perceptible colorchange when conventional mouth rinse was used, and the printed resin showed thegreatest median +/-interquartile range DeltaE00 (2.24 +/-0.2). In both short- andlong-term simulations, the printed resin rinsed with the conventional mouth rinseshowed significantly greater roughness than that rinsed with distilled water(P<.009). CONCLUSIONS: The printed resin showed higher stainability than theconventional resin, and the color change was greatest with the conventional mouthrinse. However, in 6 months of daily mouth rinse simulation, all the tested resinmaterials exhibited imperceptible color change and clinically acceptable surface roughness.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.06.002 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies to determine a suitable surface treatment thatimproves bonding without compromising the strength or translucency ofultratranslucent zirconia are scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro studywas to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on translucency,surface topography, phase transformation, biaxial flexural strength, bondstrength, and durability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 169 ultratranslucentzirconia disks were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the surfacetreatment applied: airborne-particle abrasion (APA) (n=46), tribochemical silica airborne-particle abrasion (TS) (n=46), nonthermal oxygen plasma (NTP) (n=46),and no treatment, control (C) (n=31). The translucency parameter (DeltaTP00) was evaluated with a spectrophotometer (n=15), phase transformation was assessed withan X-ray diffractometer (n=5), surface topography was evaluated with a scanningelectron microscope (SEM) (n=3), and biaxial flexural strength (BFS) was testedwith a universal testing machine (n=15). For the microshear bond strength (muSBS)test, 40 composite resin specimens were attached to 8 disks and tested with auniversal testing machine; 20 specimens were tested after 24 hours, and 20specimens after hydrothermal aging in a thermocycler (TC). The data were analyzedwith ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test (alpha=.05). Weibull analysis was performed for the flexural strength and muSBS results. RESULTS: SignificantDeltaTP00 differences were found among all groups and were highest for the APAgroup (7.33) and lowest for the NTP group (4.79). The NTP group had asignificantly higher monoclinic weight fraction value (4.54%) than other groups. The NTP group had significantly higher BFS (581.31) than other groups, while the APA group showed significantly lower values than other groups (340.43). The APAgroup had significantly higher muSBS values after 24 hours (13.51 MPa) and after TC (13.68 MPa) than the other groups (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although APA and TSare effective techniques for improving resin-zirconia bonding, they result insignificantly higher deterioration of translucency and strength. NTPsignificantly improved the BFS of zirconia; however, it showed lower bondstrength values than other methods.

AB  - We studied the effect of Tianma Gouteng Decoction on vascular aging inspontaneously hypertensive rats(SHRs) to explore the molecular mechanism of thedecoction in improving arterial vascular aging by regulating the expression ofmitofusin 2(MFN2).Twenty 64-weeks-old SHRs were randomly assigned into the aging group and the treatment group(Tianma Gouteng Decoction 5.48mg.kg~(-1)).Wistar-Kyoto(WKY) rats of 64 weeks old were taken as the normal groupand SHR rats of 14 weeks old as the young group.The intervention with TianmaGouteng Decoction lasted for 12 weeks.We then employed HE staining and Massonstaining to observe the morphology of thoracic aorta under an electron microscopeand measured the malondialdehyde(MDA) content, superoxide dismutase(SOD)activity, respiratory chain complex level, and thioredoxin peroxidase(TPX)activity.The vascular aging was detected via the biomarker senescence-associated beta-galactosidase(SA-beta-Gal).The expression levels of MFN2 and aging markerproteins silent information regulator 1(SIRT1), Klotho, p21, and p53 in thoracic aorta were detected by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Westernblot.Compared with the young group and the normal group, the aging group hadrisen blood pressure, lumen stenosis caused by thickened intima of blood vessels,decreased SOD and TPX activities, increased MDA and mitochondrial respiratorychain complex levels, down-regulated expression of MFN2, SIRT1, and Klotho, andup-regulated expression of p21 and p53(P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05).The treatment withTianma Gouteng Decoction significantly lowered blood pressure, mitigated vascularintimal thickening, increased SOD and TPX activities, and decreased MDA andmitochondrial respiratory chain complex levels, thus alleviating vascularaging.At the same time, the decoction up-regulated the expression of MFN2, SIRT1,and Klotho, while down-regulated that of p21 and p53(P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05).Insummary, Tianma Gouteng Decoction can significantly delay the vascular aging inhypertension.Specifically, it may up-regulate the expression of MFN2 and regulatethe expression of aging-related proteins to alleviate oxidative stress.

AB  - This paper explored the protective effect of total flavonoids of Rhododendronsimsii(TFR) on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury(CIRI) in rats and itsrelationship with the store-operated calcium entry(SOCE) pathway regulated bystromal intera-ction molecule(STIM) and calcium release-activated calciummodulator(Orai).Rats were randomly assigned into the sham group, model(middlecerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) group, TFR(60 mg.kg~(-1)) group, TFR(60mg.kg~(-1))+SOCE pathway inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate(2-APB, 2.5mg.kg~(-1)) group, and 2-APB(2.5 mg.kg~(-1)) group.The rats in the sham group andMCAO group were administrated with normal saline, and those in the TFR group and TFR+2-APB group were administrated with TFR(60 mg.kg~(-1)) by gavage for 14 days until sampling.The rats in the 2-APB group and TFR+2-APB group wereintraperitoneally injected with 2-APB(2.5 mg.kg~(-1)) after operation.The levels of interleukin-1(IL-1), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosisfactor-alpha(TNF-alpha) in serum were measured by ELISA.The cerebral infarctionand the pathological status of ischemic brain tissue were detected via TTCstaining and HE staining, respectively.The protein and mRNA levels of STIM1,STIM2, Orai1, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3(caspase-3), and proteinkinase B(PKB) in brain tissue were respectively determined by Western blot andRT-qPCR.The growth of brain neurons in each group was observed viaimmunofluorescence method.The results showed that compared with the MCAO group,TFR lowered the levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in serum and the score ofneurological function, ameliorated the pathological injury of brain tissue, anddecreased the infarct size.Moreover, TFR up-regulated the mRNA and protein levelsof STIM1, STIM2, Orai1, and PKB, down-regulated those of caspase-3 in braintissue, and increased the double-labeled positive cells under fluorescencemicroscope.However, the above effects were significantly weakened by the additionof 2-APB, a SOCE inhibitor.The results suggested that TFR may play a protectiverole against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by up-regulating theexpression of SOCE-related signal molecules, promoting neurogenesis around theischemic area, improving the survival state of neurons, and redu-cing theactivity of inflammatory mediators.

TI  - [To explore mechanism of Scabiosa comosa against liver fibrosis based onpharmacodynamics and network pharmacology].
PG  - 3609-3618
LID - 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220207.702 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to systematically elucidate the pharmacodynamics and networkpharmacological mechanism of Mongolian medicinal plants Scabiosa comosa, explore their key targets and related pathways, and further clarify the mechanism of the plants in treating liver fibrosis. Wistar rats were assigned into the blankgroup, carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis model group, and low-,medium-, and high-dose S. comosa groups. HE staining and Masson staining wereperformed for the observation of liver tissue under a microscope. Further, Wistarrats were assigned into a control group and a S. comosa group for administration.Seven days later, blood was collected from the abdominal aorta, and differentdoses of drug-containing serum samples were used to treat hepatic stellatecell-T6(HSC-T6). Flow cytometry was adopted to detect the apoptosis of HSC-T6cells. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-massspectrometry(UHPLC-TOF-MS) was employed to determine the components in Scabiosacomosa. The target of S. comosa and liver fibrosis were obtained fromSwissTargetPrediction and GeneCards, respectively, and the common targets wereselected as the anti-liver fibrosis targets. Protein-protein interaction wasanalyzed via STRING. Gene Ontology(GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment were carried out via Metascape.Phosphatidylinosital 3-kinase(PI3 K), protein kinase B(AKT), p-AKT, p38, andp-p38 targets which are involved in the top-ranked PI3 K/AKT and mitogenactivated kinase-like protein(MAPK) signaling pathways were selected forvalidation via Western blot. The HE and Masson staining results showed thatScabiosa alleviated the hyperplasia of connective tissue and the fibrosis. Theserum containing Scabiosa significantly promoted the apoptosis of HSC-T6 in aconcentration-dependent manner. A total of 76 chemical components were identifiedby UHPLC-TOF-MS, among which flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols, andfatty acids were the main components. According to the prediction, there were 63 anti-liver fibrosis targets in Scabiosa comosa, the annotated GO terms of whichinvolved biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. The KEGGpathway enrichment showed that the targets were mainly involved in PI3 K/AKT,epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), RAS-associated protein 1(Rap1),hypoxia-inducible factor 1(HIF-1), resistance to audiogenic seizures(Ras), andMAPK signaling pathways. Western blot results showed that compared with the modelgroup, S. comosa down-regulated the protein levels of alpha-smooth muscleactin(alpha-SMA), collagen , PI3 K, AKT, p-AKT, p38, and p-p38 in liver tissue.Compared with the control group, the low-, medium-, and high-dose S. comosasignificantly down-regulated the protein levels of alpha-SMA, collagen , PI3 K,AKT, p-AKT, p38, and p-p38 in HSC-T6. The evidence of pharmacodynamics, networkpharmacology, and molecular biology indicated that the plants of S. comosa hadsignificant activity against liver fibrosis, the mechanism of which may involvethe regulation of the key targets PI3 K, AKT, and MAPK14 p38 in the PI3 K/AKT andMAPK signaling pathways.

AB  - Commercial X-ray computed tomography (CT) contrast agents (CAs) are notappropriate for multicolor CT imaging and are limited due to a lack of tumortargeting. In this contribution, to favor the combination of high Z elements likebismuth and iodine for a broad range of X-ray photon energy, BiOI nanoparticles(NPs) are synthesized with hyaluronic acid (HA) coating to target the tumor cellswith CD44 overexpression. The crystal structure of BiOI NPs is determined byX-ray powder diffraction, and the size of NPs is determined by a transmissionelectron microscope at about 14 +/- 3 nm. The dynamic diameter of the NPs (DLS)in PBS buffer was measured at about 100 nm. Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis confirm the coating of BiOI NPswith HA. The stability of the NPs was also investigated via UV-vis spectroscopy. The immunocytochemistry process is performed to investigate the targeting abilityof synthesized NPs on the human colon cancer cells with CD44 antigen. Finally,the X-ray attenuation of prepared HA-coated BiOI NPs is higher than Iohexol asthe commercially available iodinated contrasting agent at the sameconcentrations, which can be administrated at much lower doses to achieve similarcontrast to Iohexol.

AB  - Ceramic composites based on (Ce, Y)-TZP/Al2O3 system have great potential forapplications as dental implants due to their unusually great balance between goodmechanical properties and resistance to hydrothermal degradation. Surfaceroughness plays an important role in controlling these properties, but fewstudies have investigated the relationship between cytocompatibility and surface roughness, at levels considered moderate and low, comparable to titaniumimplants. In this work, bending strength, hydrothermal degradation and biologicalevaluation of a ceramic composite based on (Ce,Y)-TZP/Al2O3 system wereinvestigated as a function of surface roughness. Compacted samples were sintered at 1500 degrees C - 2h and then submitted to different surface treatments: Group 1 composed of samples with smooth surfaces, Group 2 and Group 3 composed of roughsurfaces (grinded with 15 mum or 45 mum diamond sandpaper, respectively. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, contactangle and optical profilometry and then subjected to hydrothermal degradationtests in autoclave (134 degrees C - 2 bar) using artificial saliva. ThePiston-on-three-balls (P-3B) testing was used to determine flexural strength. To assess indirect cytotoxicity, samples were immersed in the culture medium forNIH-3T3 cells for 72 h. Furthermore, cell adhesion and proliferation wereinvestigated using MG63 cells (human osteosarcoma) after 3, 7, 14, and 21 days ofculture. Cytotoxicity, adhesion, and cell proliferation were examined by theMethyl Tetrazolium salt (MTS) and Alizarin Red, using a confocal lasermicroscope. The results indicated that the materials have high resistance todegradation. Furthermore, the (Ce,Y)-TZP/Al2O3 composites are not cytotoxic. The flexural strength of the composites was 913 +/- 103 MPa in samples presentingoriginal (smooth) surface, however, a reduction in the order of 17% was observed in samples containing rough surfaces. The rougher samples show the best cellular adhesion and proliferation, leading to the formation of a mineralized matrixafter 21 days. These results clearly suggest that the new (Ce,Y)-TZP/Al2O3 brand is strong and highly biocompatible and warrants further study.

AB  - Oral carcinoma is one of the most vicious forms of cancer with a very lowsurvival rate, as its patients often respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy.Presently several researchers are attempting to pursue an alternative to thistherapy using natural products. Considering the promising strategy and induction of apoptosis to target the cancer cells, we evaluated the influence of a seaweed Padina gymnospora (15 microg/ml and 20 microg/ml) in enhancing apoptosis of oral cancer cells (KB-CHR-8-5) after 24-h incubation. The morphological changesindicating apoptosis were primarily assessed using a light microscope after whichthe apoptosis was confirmed by performing AO/EB staining method. Subsequently,MMP and ROS levels in the cells were assessed using Rh 123 and DCFH-DA stainingprocedures, respectively. All the above tests confirmed the ability of P.gymnospora to accelerate apoptosis in the oral cancer cells. As a next step, wideproteome analysis was performed where the proteins from P. gymnospora-treatedcells were separated using the 2D electrophoresis technique and compared withthat of control cells to isolate the differentially expressed proteins. Thisprocedure resulted in the isolation of 10 proteins which were identified usingMALDI-TOF/TOF MS, which established that most of the isolated proteins were part of the apoptotic process of the cell. The proteins identified are part of hugeand complex pathways where it gets linked with many more genes which are alsoassociated with apoptosis. Bioinformatics of these identified proteins wasanalyzed using STRING and PANTHER databases. These proteins contribute to cellapoptosis by affecting various functions, biological processes, and the synthesisof cellular components. PANTHER also demonstrated that these proteins belong tothe classes of proteins that take part in several vital pathways of the cellamong which the apoptotic pathway is the predominant one.

LID - 10.1002/bio.4340 [doi]
AB  - The synthesis of BiPO4 :Eu(3+) phosphors has been achieved via a wet chemicalprocess. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the phase of the as-preparedsamples matches very well with the standard BiPO4 structure. At 395 nm, thehighest excitation intensity was observed. Following 395 nm excitation, twocharacteristic emission peaks at 592 nm and 616 nm were shown. At 0.5 mol% ofEu(3+) ions, concentration quenching occurred. The particle size is within themicrometre range, according to the scanning electron microscope magnification.The chromaticity coordinates for wavelengths 592 nm and 616 nm are (x = 0.586, y = 0.412) and (x = 0.682, y = 0.317), respectively. The findings imply that theprepared phosphor may be used to create white light-emitting diodes.

TI  - The Peel-Blot Technique: A Cryo-EM Sample Preparation Method to Separate SingleLayers from Multi-Layered or Concentrated Biological Samples.
LID - 10.3791/64099 [doi]
AB  - The peel-blot cryo-EM grid preparation technique is a significantly modifiedback-injection method with the objective of achieving a reduction in layers ofmulti-layered samples. This removal of layers prior to plunge freezing can aid inreducing sample thickness to a level suitable for cryo-EM data collection,improving sample flatness, and facilitating image processing. The peel-blottechnique allows for the separation of multilamellar membranes into singlelayers, of layered 2D crystals into individual crystals, and of stacked,sheet-like structures of soluble proteins to likewise be separated into singlelayers. The high sample thickness of these types of samples frequently posesinsurmountable problems for cryo-EM data collection and cryo-EM image processing,especially when the microscope stage must be tilted for data collection.Furthermore, grids of high concentrations of any of these samples can be preparedfor efficient data collection since sample concentration prior to gridpreparation can be increased and the peel-blot technique adjusted to result in a dense distribution of single-layered specimen.

TI  - The mouthparts of the adult dragonfly Anax imperator (Insecta: Odonata),functional morphology and feeding kinematics.
LID - 10.1002/jmor.21497 [doi]
AB  - Insects evolved differently specialized mouthparts. We study the mouthparts ofadult Anax imperator, one of the largest odonates found in Central Europe. Likeall adult dragonflies, A. imperator possesses carnivorous-type of biting-chewing mouthparts. To gain insights into the feeding process, behavior and kinematics,living specimens were filmed during feeding using synchronized high-speedvideography. Additionally, the maximum angles of movement were measured using ameasuring microscope and combined with data from micro-computed tomography. Theresulting visualizations of the 3D-geometry of each mouthpart were used to study their anatomy and complement the existing descriptive knowledge of muscles in A. imperator to date. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy-projectionsallow for estimation of differences in the material composition of themouthparts' cuticle. By combining all methods, we analyze possible functions and underlying biomechanics of each mouthpart. We also analyzed the concertedmovements of the mouthparts; unique behavior of the mouthparts during feeding is active participation by the labrum and distinct movement by the maxillarylaciniae. We aim to elucidate the complex movements of the mouthparts and theirfunctioning by combining detailed information on (1) in vivo movement behavior(supplemented with physiological angle approximations), (2) movement abilityprovided by morphology (morphological movement angles), (3) 3D-anatomy, and (4)cuticle composition estimates.

AB  - Objective: To construct three-dimensional (3D) pre-vascularized microstructuresand explore the promoting effect of human fibroblasts (HFs) on the sprout andmigration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in 3D co-culturesystem. Methods: HUVECs and HFs were cultured and the 3rd to 5th generation cellswere selected for subsequent experiments. In 2D co-culture system, HFs werestained with PKH26 and the cell density was fixed, which co-cultured with HUVECs in different ratios (1ratio4, 1ratio1, 4ratio1) and inoculation methods (HUVECsinoculation at 48 hours after HFs, direct mixed inoculation). Then the formation of vascular like structures was observed under fluorescence microscope. In 3Dco-culture system, HUVECs and HFs were labeled with green fluorescent protein andred fluorescent protein by lentivirus transfection, respectively. They wereinoculated on porous micro-carriers followed by dynamically culturing in rotatingbottles to prepare HF, HUVEC, HF-EC, or HF&EC microstructures. The cell growth inmicrostructures was testing by low permeability crystal violet staining.Subsequently, the microstructures were embedded in fibrin gel and the cell growthand adhesion in HF and HUVEC microstructures were observed by laser confocalmicroscopy. Laser confocal microscope were also used to observe the sprouts of 4 kinds of microstructures, as well as the cell composition, the number and length of sprouts from HF-EC and HF&EC microstructures. HFs conditioned medium wasprepared to observe its effect on sprouts of HUVEC microstructures with DMEM ascontrol group. Results: In 2D co-culture system, HFs pre-culturing was helpful tothe formation and stability of vascular like structures, and the best effect was when the ratio of two kinds of cells was 1ratio1. In 3D co-culture system, it wasfound that the cells grew well on micro-carriers and had the ability ofpre-vascularization. HUVEC microstructures did not sprout, but HF, HF-EC, andHF&EC microstructures could which indicated a good vascularization ability. TheHF-EC microstructures were superior to HF&EC microstructures in terms of sprouts length and number ( P<0.05). The tubes sprouting from co-cultured group werecomposed of HFs and HUVECs, and HF microstructures migration preceded HUVECmicrostructures always, and their migration trajectories were the same. HUVECmicrostructures could sprout when cultured in HFs conditioned media. Conclusion: HF-HUVEC pre-vascularized microstructures can be prepared by pre-culturing HFsbefore HUVECs and with the cell ratio at 1ratio1 in a rotating bottle. In 3Dco-culture system, HFs can promote and guide the sprout of HUVECs.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of the deep inferior epigastricperforator (DIEP) flap for extreme defects around the knee. Methods: Between June2017 and December 2018, 15 patients with the extreme defects around the knee wereadmitted. There were 9 males and 6 females with a median age of 36 years (range, 23-51 years). The etiology was the traffic accident in 7 cases, tumor in 5 cases,and burn in 3 cases. The injured location was left knee in 8 cases and right kneein 7 cases. The size of soft tissue defects ranged from 15 cmx10 cm to 30 cmx20cm, and all defects complicated with exposure of blood vessels, nerves, tendons, and other tissues. Transverse DIEP flaps with 1-2 vascular pedicles were preparedaccording to the size of the defect, including 6 cases of single-pedicle flapsand 9 cases of double-pedicle conjoined flaps. According to the depth of thedefect, 10 cases of skin flaps were thinned under microscope. The size of theDIEP flaps ranged from 16 cmx10 cm to 32 cmx20 cm; the average thickness was 1.5 cm (range, 0.8-1.8 cm); the average pedicle length was 7.5 cm (range, 5.0-9.0cm). The donor site was directly sutured. Results: One single-pedicle flapdeveloped distal necrosis after operation, and healed after skin grafting; theother skin flaps survived, and the wounds at the donor and recipient sites healedby first intention. All patients were followed up 16-28 months (mean, 24 months).The shape and texture of the flap were satisfactory, and there was no abnormalhair growth or obvious pigmentation. There was only linear scar at the donor siteand no complication such as abdominal hernia. The appearance and function of the knee were satisfactory. No recurred tumor was observed, and the scar contracture was released. At last follow-up, 13 cases were excellent and 2 cases were good,according to the Knee Society Score (KSS) criteria. Conclusion: The DIEP flap is an ideal alternative for repairing the extreme defects around knee, with aconcealed donor site, easy dissection, flexible design, as well as lesscomplication.

TI  - Effects of epsilon-polylysine and chitooligosaccharide Maillard reaction productson quality of refrigerated sea bass fillets.
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.12125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Maillard reaction is a promising and safe method for obtainingchitooligosaccharide conjugates with proteins or peptides as food preservatives. This study aims to investigate the moisture state, physicochemical properties,and shelf-life of sea bass fillets treated with epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL)and chitooligosaccharides (COS), which are Maillard reaction products (LC-MRPs), during refrigerated storage. RESULTS: The results of microbiological analysis andconfocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) revealed that LC-MRPs could retardmicrobial growth effectively. Compared with control, other treated groups couldstrongly retard the increase in the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, the K-value and the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) value, and also inhibited thesoftening of texture and the accumulation of biogenic amines in fish. The resultsof low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) indicate that LC-MRPs could delay the water migration of fillets andincrease water holding capacity (WHC). Through sensory evaluation, theapplication of LC-MRPs increased the shelf-life of refrigerated sea bass fillets for another 9 days. CONCLUSION: Maillard reaction products derived fromchitooligosaccharides and epsilon-polylysine have strong potential for preservingsea bass. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The presence of protein corona on the surface of nanoparticles modulates theirphysiological interactions such as cellular association and targeting property.It has been shown that alpha-mangostin (alphaM)-loaded poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(l-lactide) (PEG-PLA) nanoparticles (NP-alphaM) specificallyincreased low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression in microglia andimproved clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) after multiple administration.However, how do the nanoparticles cross the bloodbrain barrier and accessmicroglia remain unknown. Here, we studied the brain delivery property of PEG-PLAnanoparticles under different conditions, finding that the nanoparticlesexhibited higher brain transport efficiency and microglia uptake efficiency afteralphaM loading and multiple administration. To reveal the mechanism, we performedproteomic analysis to characterize the composition of protein corona formed undervarious conditions, finding that both drug loading and multiple dosing affect thecomposition of protein corona and subsequently influence the cellular uptake ofnanoparticles in b.End3 and BV-2 cells. Complement proteins, immunoglobulins,RAB5A and CD36 were found to be enriched in the corona and associated with theprocess of nanoparticles uptake. Collectively, we bring a mechanisticunderstanding about the modulator role of protein corona on targeted drugdelivery, and provide theoretical basis for engineering brain ormicroglia-specific targeted delivery system.

AB  - Background: Blocking and even reversing gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) is akey measure to lower the incidence of gastric cancer. Atractylenolide III(AT-III) is a mainly active component of the Atractylodes rhizome and has beenwidely used in tumor treatment. However, the effects of AT-III on GPL and itsmechanisms have not been reported. Methods: H & E staining and AB-PAS stainingwere employed to evaluate the histopathology in the gastric mucosa. In parallel, CD34 immunostaining was performed for angiogenesis assessment, and transmissionelectron microscope for microvessel ultrastructural observation. Investigationfor the possible mechanism in vivo and in vitro was conducted usingimmunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and western blotting. Results: In most GPLspecimens, AT-III treatment reduced microvascular abnormalities and attenuatedearly angiogenesis, with the regression of most intestinal metaplasia and partialdysplasia. Meanwhile, the expression of VEGF-A and HIF-1alpha was enhanced in GPLsamples of model rats, and their expressions were decreased in AT-III-treated GPLrats. Moreover, DLL4 mRNA and protein expression were higher in GPL rats than in control rats. DLL4 protein expression was significantly enhanced in human GPLtissues. In addition, AT-III treatment could diminish DLL4 mRNA level and proteinexpression in the MNNG-induced GPL rats. In vitro study showed that in AGS andHGC-27 cells, DLL4 mRNA level and protein expression were significantly decreasedafter AT-III treatment. However, AT-III had no significant regulatory effect onNotch1 and Notch4. Conclusion: AT-III treatment is beneficial in lesseninggastric precancerous lesions and attenuating angiogenesis in rats, and that maybe contributed by the decrease of angiogenesis-associated HIF-1alpha and VEGF-A, and downregulation of DLL4.

AB  - Building practices began with human civilization. Cement is the most commonlyused building construction material throughout the world. These traditionalbuilding materials have their own environmental impact during production,transportation, and construction, but also have limitations on building qualityand cost. Biological construction materials are currently emerging technology to combat emissions from the construction sector. Different civil and biotechnology researchers have turned to microorganisms for the production of bio construction materials that are environmentally friendly, socially acceptable, andeconomically feasible but can also produce high strength. Scanning electronmicroscope (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) are the most characterizationmethods used to observe and ensure the production of calcite precipitate asbacterial concrete. As compared to conventional concrete, bacterial concrete was greater by 35.15% in compressive strength, 24.32% in average tensile strength,and 17.24% in average flexural strength, and it was 4 times lower in waterabsorption and 8 times lower in acid resistivity than conventional concrete.Genetic engineering has great potential to further enhance the mechanicalstrength of bacterial concrete for use in crack repairs in existing buildings.

TI  - Sauropod dinosaur teeth from the lower Upper Cretaceous Winton Formation ofQueensland, Australia and the global record of early titanosauriforms.
PG  - 220381
LID - 10.1098/rsos.220381 [doi]
AB  - The Upper Cretaceous Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia, has producedseveral partial sauropod skeletons, but cranial remains-including teeth-remainrare. Herein, we present the first description of sauropod teeth from thisformation, based on specimens from three separate sites. An isolated tooth and a dentary fragment from the Diamantinasaurus matildae type locality are considered to be referable to that titanosaurian taxon. A single tooth from the D. matildae referred specimen site is similarly regarded as being part of that individual.Seventeen teeth from a new site that are morphologically uniform, and similar to the teeth from the two Diamantinasaurus sites, are assigned to Diamantinasauria. All sauropod teeth recovered from the Winton Formation to date arecompressed-cone-chisel-shaped, have low slenderness index values (2.00-2.88), arelingually curved at their apices, mesiodistally convex on their lingual surfaces,and lack prominent carinae and denticles. They are markedly different from thechisel-like teeth of derived titanosaurs, more closely resembling the teeth ofearly branching members of the titanosauriform radiation. This provides furthersupport for a 'basal' titanosaurian position for Diamantinasauria. Scanningelectron microscope microwear analysis of the wear facets of several teethreveals more scratches than pits, implying that diamantinasaurians weremid-height (1-10 m) feeders. With a view to assessing the spatio-temporaldistribution of sauropod tooth morphotypes before and after deposition of theWinton Formation, we provide a comprehensive continent-by-continent review of theearly titanosauriform global record (Early to early Late Cretaceous). Thisindicates that throughout the Early-early Late Cretaceous, sauropod faunastransitioned from being quite diverse at higher phylogenetic levels andencompassing a range of tooth morphologies at the start of the Berriasian, tofaunas comprising solely titanosaurs with limited dental variability by theend-Turonian. Furthermore, this review highlights the different ways in whichthis transition unfolded on each continent, including the earliest records oftitanosaurs with narrow-crowned teeth on each continent.

AB  - Photocatalytic degradation method has been recognized as an effective way toeliminate the contamination of environment. However, developing photocatalystswith excellent photocatalytic properties are still a big challenge. In thispaper, Ag doped ZnO coating with a layer of N doped porous carbon(Ag/ZnO@N-carbon) was successfully synthesized by using polyvinyl pyrrolidone(PVP) modified ZIF-8 as precursor via adsorption, hydrothermal treatment, in situgrowth and carbonization processes. The physical and chemical properties of allsamples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electronmicroscope (SEM), electron transmission microscopy (TEM) and so on. The resultsshow that Ag doping does not change the crystallinity of ZnO, but broaden itsphoto-response property. The coating of N doped carbon can improve the specificsurface area of photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of all samples wasevaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solution under UV light irradiationfor 25 min. Ag/ZnO@N-carbon exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity fordegradation of RhB with a degradation of 98.65%. Furthermore, Ag/ZnO@N-carbonalso has high stability. Based on the characterization, possible mechanism fordegradation of RhB by Ag/ZnO@N-carbon under UV light irradiation was proposed.

AB  - Herein, the impact of the halloysite nanotubes to suppress the side effects ofAsparaginase (ANase) cellular proliferation was investigated. Methods: A total of100 adult male mice was employed. These mice were divided into four equal groups;Group 1 (control), Group 2 (ESC group) of a single dose of 0.15 ml Ehrlich cells (2 x 10(6)) intraperitoneal infusion(IP), Group 3 (ESC + ANase group) receivedsix doses equal treatments of Intratumoral (IT) 0.07 ml Aspragnase (7 mg/kg) overtwo weeks. For two weeks, Group 4 (ESC + ASNase + HNTs) received an ITadministration of 0.07 ml Asparaginase stocked on Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) (30mg/kg) three times per week. A blood specimen was collected, and the liver wasremoved to be investigated histologically. Results: TEM measurements for theHalloysite nanoclay showed their tubular cylindrical shape with a mean diameterof 50 nm and an average length of 1 mum, whereas The X-ray diffraction pattern ofthe Halloysite nanoclay showed their characteristic peaks. ESC increases theserum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkalinephosphatase, and bilirubin than control and other groups, even as albumin andtotal protein were decreasing. After using Halloysite Nanotube, the rates ofthese variables were enhanced up to 75%. The hepatocytes histological studiesshowed protection against Ehrlich Solid carcinoma-induced degenerative, necrotic,and inflammatory changes up to 70%. In conclusion, halloysite nanotubes havedemonstrated effective removal of Ehrlich solid carcinoma in mice using an ASNasedelivery system. It promoted the ASNase to inhibit the adverse effect of ANase's on the liver and remove the tumour cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent intermittent bleeding control and suction are oftennecessary during microneurosurgical procedures. We compared the visual searching strategy that guides these types of gross hand movements between expert surgeons and neurosurgical residents. METHODS: A total of 70 trials of a microsurgicaltask consisting of moving a cotton ball with bipolar forceps and a suctioninstrument under the microscope were recorded. Based on surgical videos, weextracted the total task time, the boarding time, the gaze-tool time gap, thenumber of fixations during the boarding time and the target-locked fixationduration. A comparison of these measures between experts and resident surgeonswere performed. RESULTS: No significant difference was found for the total tasktime, the boarding time, and the number of fixations during the boarding timebetween the two groups of surgeons. However, we found significant differences in the measure of gaze-tool time gap (p < .001, partial eta(2) = 0.54) and thetarget-locked fixation (p < .001, partial eta(2) = 0.24). Specifically, expertmicrosurgeons' eyes move to the target board earlier before their tools in hands move (1.01 +/- 0.30 s) comparing to resident microsurgeons (0.44 +/- 0.17 s). Thetarget-locked fixation duration was also longer among experts comparing toresidents (experts: 1.16 +/- 0.82 s, residents: 0.40 +/- 0.30 msec). CONCLUSION: Task time analysis for this basic microsurgical task is not sufficient toevaluate participants' level of expertise. Gaze behavior analysis helps to revealhidden differences between experts and residents. This research provides another evidence that supports the use of gaze analysis for assessing surgeons' skills inmicrosurgery.

AB  - The desire of producing marketable green bio-composites displaying goodfunctional properties has increased. Biodegradable composites are a subject ofinterest as they respond to ecological concerns. In this study, an eco-friendlyalkali-laccase modification was used to improve the interfacial adhesion of mukwawood fiber and polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. The untreated and treated mukwa-PLA composites were fabricated via extrusion and compression molding technique andinvestigated. The mukwa wood fibers and mukwa-PLA composites were characterizedby chemical composition, crystallite size, Fourier transform infraredspectroscope (FTIR), mechanical properties, and scanning electron microscope(SEM) respectively. The cellulose content was found to increase, while thehemicellulose, lignin, and extractives reduced after the surface modifications.The alkali-laccase, laccase, and alkali modifications increased the tensilestrength of the untreated/PLA composites by 12.3 %, 5.2 %, and 3.8 %respectively. The flexural strength of the composites reached a maximum of 95.1MPa following the alkali-laccase treatment. The alkali-laccase treated compositesshowed increased impact strength of 53.9 % on the untreated/PLA composites. Good correlations between the crystallite size and the mechanical properties werereported, with the highest R-square (R(2)) value of 1 found between the impactstrength and crystallite size. The modifications strengthened the interactionbetween mukwa and PLA as more voids, fiber pull-outs, and debondingcharacteristics were observed on SEM microstructures of untreated/PLA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spatial complexity of neuronal circuits in the central nervoussystem is a hurdle in understanding and treating brain and spinal cord injury(SCI). Although several methods have recently been developed to render the spinalcord transparent and label specific neural circuits, three-dimensionalvisualization of long segments of spinal cord with high resolution remainschallenging for SCI researchers. NEW METHOD: We present a method that combinestissue staining of neuronal tracts traced with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)and a modified passive clarity clearing protocol to describe individual fibers inlong segments of mouse spinal cord. RESULTS: Corticospinal tract was traced with BDA with a mouse model of thoracic spinal cord injury. The spinal cord wasstained and cleared in two weeks with four solutions: staining solution, hydrogelsolution, clearing solution, and observation solution. The samples were observed with a light-sheet microscope, and three-dimensional reconstruction was performedwith ImageJ software. High resolution-images comparable with tissue sections wereobtained continuously and circumferentially. By tiling, it was possible to obtainhigh-resolution images of long segments of the spinal cord. The tissue could beeasily re-stained in case of fading. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Thepresent method does not require special equipment such as vacuum devices, canlabel specific circuits without genetic technology, and re-staining rounds can beeasily implemented. CONCLUSIONS: By using simple neural staining and clearingmethods, it was possible to acquire a wide range of high-resolutionthree-dimensional images of the spinal cord.

AB  - The development of chemo/photothermal nanotherapeutic systems with excellentphotothermal performance, stable drug loading, tumor targeting and strongmembrane penetration still remains a challenge. To address this problem, herein arod-like nanocomposite system (AuNR@FA-PR/PEG) forming from folic acid (FA)terminated carboxylated cyclodextrin (CD) pseudopolyrotaxane (FA-PR) andpolyethylene glycol (PEG) modifying gold nanorods (AuNR) was reported. Cisplatin (CDDP) was loaded in AuNR@FA-PR/PEG via coordination bonds to prepare a rod-like pH-responsive nanosystem (AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP) with chemotherapy/photothermaltherapy. The rod-like morphology of AuNR@FA-PR/PEG was characterized bytransmission electron microscope. In vitro drug release experiments showed thepH-responsive of AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP. In vivo real-time imaging assays provedAuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP could rapidly enrich in the tumor area and stay for a longtime because of folate targeting and their rod-like morphology. In vivophotothermal imaging assays showed AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP excellent photothermalperformance, the average temperature of tumor region could reach 63.5 degrees Cafter 10 min irradiation. In vitro and in vivo experiments also demonstrated thatthe combined therapy of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy had anoutstandingly synergistic effect and improved the therapeutic efficacy comparing with chemotherapy and photothermal therapy alone. Therefore, the preparedrod-like AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP will provide a new strategy for the effectivetreatment of cancer.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: How implant alignment impacts stud attachment retention andwear-induced alterations, notably when the attachment exhibits metal-to-metalfrictional interlocking, is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of the interimplant angulation on retention forces andwear changes before and after 2 years of simulated clinical use of implantoverdentures retained by titanium stud overdenture attachments. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS: The canine regions of 3 identical edentulous mandibular models were usedto receive 2 dental implants analogs with TiTach attachments (Dental Evolutions, Inc) at interimplant angulations of 0, 30, and 60 degrees. Six identicaloverdentures were constructed over each model (n=6). A universal testing machine was used to determine overdenture retention forces at 0, after 1440, and after2880 insertion and removal cycles to simulate the average insertion and removalcycles in 12 and 24 months. A stereomicroscope, a laser microscope, and ascanning electron microscope were used to evaluate the wear in the attachments. Alinear regression model, ANOVA, and the Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyzethe data (alpha=.05). RESULTS: All groups demonstrated reduced retention over thestudy duration (P<.001). The retention forces of the 0- and 30-degree groups werenot significantly different after 2880 insertion and removal cycles, but bothwere significantly higher than those of the 60-degree group (P=.002). Within eachgroup, the wear pattern of the matrix cap was more noticeable than that of thepatrix abutment, with increased wear changes as interimplant angulation increased(P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: TiTach attachments could retain overdentures on paralleland divergent implants with a 30-degree angle of interimplant angulation.However, at a 60-degree angle of interimplant angulation, considerable reduction in retention forces and increased wear changes were observed after 2 years ofsimulated clinical use.

AB  - In recent years, the zebrafish has become a well-established laboratory model. Wedescribe here the ZeBraInspector (ZBI) platform for high-content 3D imaging (HCI)of 5 days post-fertilization zebrafish eleuthero-embryos (EEs). This platformincludes a mounting method based on 3D-printed stamps to create a grid of wellsin an agarose cast, facilitating batch acquisitions with a fast-confocal laserscanning microscope. We describe reference labeling in cleared fish with afluorescent lipophilic dye. Based on this labeling, the ZBI software registers.EE 3D images, making it possible to visualize numerous identically oriented EEson a single screen, and to compare their morphologies and any fluorescentpatterns at a glance. High-resolution 2D snapshots can be extracted. ZBI softwareis therefore useful for diverse high-content analyses (HCAs). Following automatedsegmentation of the lipophilic dye signal, the ZBI software performs volumetricanalyses on whole EEs and their nervous system white matter. Through twoexamples, we illustrate the power of these analyses for obtaining statisticallysignificant results from a small number of samples: the characterization of aphenotype associated with a neurodevelopmental mutation, and of the defectscaused by treatments with a toxic anti-cancer compound.

AB  - A new method of alliin infusion into potato strips to generate garlic flavor uponfrying was investigated. Potato strips were treated using pulsed electric field(PEF) and then allin was infused into the treated strips using immersion,ultrasound, or vacuum assisted infusion. Results showed that under lower PEFintensities (0.250, 0.650 and 1.250 kJ/kg), assisted infusion methodssignificantly improve alliin infusion efficiency (p < 0.05). The kinetics foralliin infusion showed that 1.250 kJ/kg PEF treatment and 35 kHz ultrasoundassisted infusion have the highest a values of 94.69 and 94.80 (mg/mL(.)h),respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) highlighted different cellstructural changes before and after being treated with different PEF intensities and infusion methods. Sensory evaluations confirmed generation of garlic flavorupon frying (p < 0.05).

TI  - The preparation and evaluation mechanism of mesoporous spherical silica/porouscarbon-filled polypropylene composites obtained from coal gasification fine slag.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21976-3 [doi]
AB  - Coal gasification fine slag is a by-product of the entrained-flow gasifier, whichhas caused some environmental pollution. Through acid dissolution and calcinationat different temperatures, mesoporous spherical silica/porous carbon compositefiller was prepared using coal gasification fine slag. The particle size andspecific surface area of the composite filler decreased with the decrease ofunburned carbon content. The analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)indicated the decrease of oxygen-containing functional groups and the increase ofC-C groups with the decrease of the content of carbon. The effects of mesoporous spherical silica/porous carbon with different carbon content on the comprehensiveproperties of filled polypropylene (PP) were studied. The tensile strength andinterface interaction increased at first and then decreased with the decrease of carbon content, due to the synergistic effect of mesoporous spherical silica and rough amorphous carbon. The scanning electron microscope showed that thecomposite filler with the carbon content of 14.47 wt.% at the calcinationtemperature of 450 degrees C had the best compatibility with the matrix.Thermodynamic analysis of the PP composites indicated that thermal insulationproperties and thermal stability improved with the incorporation of the compositefiller. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing indicated the highestcrystallinity of the matrix corresponding to the best comprehensive performances of the composites. XRD patterns revealed that the cooperation of fillers brought characteristic peaks and did not change the primary crystal structure of PP.Simultaneously, heavy calcium powders (CC) were used as comparative fillers, and the overall properties of the PP composites filled with the composite filler werebetter compared to those of the CC-filled PP composite. The results illustratedthat mesoporous spherical silica/porous carbon particles can completely replaceCC used in the PP composites, which can be used in auto bumpers, plastic pipes,display cases, and car air deflectors. The CGFS can be processed into a plasticfiller for substituting heavy calcium powder particles, which can solve theenvironmental pollution caused by the accumulation of solid waste.

PG  - e2201051
LID - 10.1002/smll.202201051 [doi]
AB  - 2D material-based heterostructures are constructed by stacking or spicingindividual 2D layers to create an interface between them, which have exoticproperties. Here, a new strategy for the in situ growth of large numbers of 2Dheterostructures on the centimeter-scale substrate is developed. In the method,large numbers of 2D MoS2 , MoO2 , or their heterostructures of MoO2 /MoS2 arecontrollably grown in the same setup by simply tuning the gap distance betweenmetal precursor and growth substrate, which changes the concentration of metalprecursors feed. A lateral force microscope is used first to identify thelocations of each material in the heterostructures, which have MoO2 on the top ofMoS2 . Noteworthy, the creation of a clean interface between atomic thin MoO2(metallic) and MoS2 (semiconducting) results in a different electronic structure compared with pure MoO2 and MoS2 . Theoretical calculations show that the charge redistribution at such an interface results in an improved HER performance on theMoO2 /MoS2 heterostructures, showing an overpotential of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1) . This work reports a new strategy for the in situ growth of heterostructures on large-scale substrates and provides platforms to exploit their applications.

TI  - Erythrocyte aggregation in sudden flow arrest is linked to hyperthermia,hypoxemia and band 3 availability.
LID - 10.1111/jth.15821 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Erythrocyte aggregation is a phenomenon that is commonly found inseveral pathological disease states: stroke, myocardial infarction, thermal burn injury, and COVID-19. Erythrocyte aggregation is characterized by rouleaux,closely packed stacks of cells, forming three-dimensional structures. Healthyblood flow monodisperses the red blood cells (RBCs) throughout the vasculature;however, in select pathological conditions, involving hyperthermia and hypoxemia,rouleaux formation remains and results in occlusion of microvessels withdecreased perfusion. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to address the kinetics ofrouleaux formation with sudden cessation of flow in variable temperature andoxygen conditions. METHODS: RBCs used in this in vitro system were obtained from healthy human donors. Using a vertical stop-flow system aligned with amicroscope, images were acquired and analyzed for increased variation ingrayscale to indicate increased aggregation. The onset of aggregation aftersudden cessation of flow was determined at proscribed temperatures (37-49(degrees ) C) and oxygen (0, 10%), and in the presence and absence of DIDS (4,4'-Diisothiocyano-2, 2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid). Both autologous and homologous plasma were tested. RESULTS: RBCs in autologous plasma aggregate faster and with a higher magnitude with both hyperthermia and hypoxemia. Preventingdeoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) from binding to band 3 with DIDS (dissociates thecytoskeleton from the membrane) fully blocks aggregation. Further, RBCaggregation magnitude is greater in autologous plasma. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the C-terminal domain of band 3 plays a pivotal role in RBC aggregation. Further,aggregation is enhanced by hyperthermia and hypoxemia.

TI  - Physiological suitability of sulfate-reducing granules for the development ofbioconcrete.
LID - 10.1002/bit.28184 [doi]
AB  - Regular monitoring and timely repair of concrete cracks are required to minimize further deterioration. Self-healing of cracks has been proposed as an alternativeto the crack maintenance procedures. One of the proposed techniques is to useaxenic cultures to exploit microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP).However, such healing agents are not cost-effective for in situ use. As themarket for bio-based self-healing concrete necessitates a low-cost bio-agent,nonaxenic sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) granules were investigated in thisstudy through cultivation in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. Thecompact granules can protect the bacteria from adverse conditions withoutencapsulation. This study investigated the microbial activities of SRB granulesat different temperatures, pH, and chemical oxygen demand concentrations whichthe microbes would experience during the concrete casting and curing process. Theattenuation and recovery of microbial activities were measured before and afterthe exposure. Moreover, the MICP yield was also tested for a possible use inself-healing bioconcrete. The results consistently showed that SRB granules were able to survive starvation, high temperature (50-60 degrees C), and high pH (12),together with scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectrometry/X-raydiffraction analysis evidence. Microbial staining analysis demonstrated theformation of spores in the granules during their exposure to harsh conditions.SRB granule was thus demonstrated to be a viable self-healing nonaxenic agent forlow-cost bioconcrete.

AB  - Cholesterol plays a unique role in the regulation of membrane organization anddynamics by modulating the membrane phase transition at the nanoscale.Unfortunately, due to their small sizes and dynamic nature, the effects ofcholesterol-mediated membrane nanodomains on membrane dynamics remain elusive.Here, using ultrahigh-speed single-molecule tracking with advanced opticalmicroscope techniques, we investigate the diffusive motion of singlephospholipids in the live cell plasma membrane at the nanoscale and itsdependency on the cholesterol concentration. We find that both saturated andunsaturated phospholipids undergo anomalous subdiffusion on the length scale of10-100 nm. The diffusion characteristics exhibit considerable variations in spaceand in time, indicating that the nanoscopic lipid diffusion is highlyheterogeneous. Importantly, through the statistical analysis, apparentdual-mobility subdiffusion is observed from the mixed diffusion behaviors. Themeasured subdiffusion agrees well with the hop diffusion model that represents a diffuser moving in a compartmentalized membrane created by the cytoskeletonmeshwork. Cholesterol depletion diminishes the lipid mobility with an apparently smaller compartment size and a stronger confinement strength. Similar results aremeasured with temperature reduction, suggesting that the more heterogeneous andrestricted diffusion is connected to the nanoscopic membrane phase transition.Our conclusion supports the model that cholesterol depletion induces theformation of gel-phase, solid-like membrane nanodomains. These nanodomainsundergo restricted diffusion and act as diffusion obstacles to the membranemolecules that are excluded from the nanodomains. This work provides theexperimental evidence that the nanoscopic lipid diffusion in the cell plasmamembrane is heterogeneous and sensitive to the cholesterol concentration andtemperature, shedding new light on the regulation mechanisms of nanoscopicmembrane dynamics.

LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2022.07.016 [doi]
AB  - Cardiomyocytes are contractile cells that regulate heart contraction. Ca(2+) fluxvia Ca(2+) channels activates actomyosin interactions, leading to cardiomyocytecontraction, which is modulated by physical factors (e.g., stretch, shear stress,and hydrostatic pressure). We evaluated the mechanism triggering slowcontractions using a high-pressure microscope to characterize changes in cellmorphology and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in mousecardiomyocytes exposed to high hydrostatic pressures. We found thatcardiomyocytes contracted slowly without an acute transient increase in[Ca(2+)]i, while a myosin ATPase inhibitor interrupted pressure-induced slowcontractions. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy showed that, althoughthe sarcomere length was shortened upon the application of 20 MPa, this pressure did not collapse cellular structures such as the sarcolemma and sarcomeres. Ourresults suggest that pressure-induced slow contractions in cardiomyocytes aredriven by the activation of actomyosin interactions without an acute transientincrease in [Ca(2+)]i.

TI  - Organ-specific extracellular matrix directs trans-differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and formation of salivary gland-like organoids in vivo.
PG  - 306
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-02993-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current treatments for salivary gland (SG) hypofunction arepalliative and do not address the underlying cause or progression of the disease.SG-derived stem cells have the potential to treat SG hypofunction, but theirisolation is challenging, especially when the tissue has been damaged by disease or irradiation for head and neck cancer. In the current study, we test thehypothesis that multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in a rat model are capable of trans-differentiating to the SG epithelial celllineage when induced by a native SG-specific extracellular matrix (SG-ECM) andthus may be a viable substitute for repairing damaged SGs. METHODS: Rat BM-MSCswere treated with homogenates of decellularized rat SG-ECM for one hour in cellsuspension and then cultured in tissue culture plates for 7 days in growth media.By day 7, the cultures contained cell aggregates and a cell monolayer. The cellaggregates were hand-selected under a dissecting microscope, transferred to a newtissue culture dish, and cultured for an additional 7 days in epithelial celldifferentiation media. Cell aggregates and cells isolated from the monolayer wereevaluated for expression of SG progenitor and epithelial cell specific markers,cell morphology and ultrastructure, and ability to form SG-like organoids invivo. RESULTS: The results showed that this approach was very effective andguided the trans-differentiation of a subpopulation of CD133-positive BM-MSCs to the SG epithelial cell lineage. These cells expressed amylase, tight junctionproteins (Cldn 3 and 10), and markers for SG acinar (Aqp5 and Mist 1) and ductal (Krt 14) cells at both the transcript and protein levels, produced intracellular secretory granules which were morphologically identical to those found insubmandibular gland, and formed SG-like organoids when implanted in the renalcapsule in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the feasibilityof using autologous BM-MSCs as an abundant source of stem cells for treating SGhypofunction and restoring the production of saliva in these patients.

TI  - Flavaspidic acid BB combined with mupirocin improves its anti-bacterial andanti-biofilm activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/s12866-022-02578-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in drug-resistant opportunistic pathogenic bacteria,especially of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis),has led to difficulties in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections(SSTI). The major reason for bacterial resistance is the formation of bacterialbiofilm. Here, we report a promising combination therapy of flavaspidic acid BB(BB) and mupirocin, which can effectively eradicate the biofilm of S. epidermidisand eliminate its drug resistance. RESULT: The susceptibility test showed thatthe combination of BB and mupirocin has good antibacterial and antibiofilmactivities, and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of BBcombined with mupirocin was 0.51 +/- 0.00 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05, showing synergisticeffect. Moreover, the time-kill curve assay results indicated that thecombination of drugs can effectively inhibit the planktonic S. epidermidis. Afterdrugs treatment, the drug-combination showed significantly inhibitory effects on the metabolic activity and total biomass in each stage of biofilm formation. The synergistic effect is likely related to the adhesion between bacteria, which isconfirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope. And the expressionlevel of aap, sarA and agrA genes were detected by real-time quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR). CONCLUSION: Our study provides the experimental data for the use of BBfor the clinical treatment of skin infections and further demonstrate thepotential of BB as a novel biofilm inhibitor.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the materialand corresponding sintering protocol, layer thickness, and aging on the two-body wear (2BW) and fracture load (FL) of 4Y-TZP crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Multi-layer 4Y-TZP crowns in three thicknesses (0.5 mm/1.0 mm/1.5 mm) weresintered by high-speed (Zolid RS) or conventional (Zolid Gen-X) sintering. 2BW ofceramic and enamel antagonist after aging (1,200,000 mechanical-, 6000thermal-cycles) was determined by 3D-scanning before and after aging andsubsequent matching to determine volume and height loss (6 subgroups, n =16/subgroup). FL was examined initially and after aging (12 subgroups, n =16/subgroup). Fractographic analyses were performed using light-microscopeimaging. Global univariate analysis of variance, one-way ANOVA, linearregression, Spearman's correlation, Kolgomorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and ttest were computed (alpha = 0.05). Weibull moduli were determined. Fracture typeswere analyzed using Ciba Geigy table. RESULTS: Material/sintering protocol didnot influence 2BW (crowns: p = 0.908, antagonists: p = 0.059). High-speedsintered Zolid RS presented similar (p = 0.325-0.633) or reduced (p <0.001-0.047) FL as Zolid Gen-X. Both 4Y-TZPs showed an increased FL with anincreasing thickness (0.5(797.3-1429 N) < 1.0(2087-2634 N) < 1.5(2683-3715 N)mm; p < 0.001). For most groups, aging negatively impacted FL (p < 0.001-0.002). Five0.5 mm specimens fractured, four showed cracks during and after aging.CONCLUSIONS: High-speed sintered crowns with a minimum thickness of 1.0 mm showedsufficient mechanical properties to withstand masticatory forces, even after asimulated aging period of 5 years. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite the manufacturerindicating a thickness of 0.5 mm to be suitable for single crowns, a minimumthickness of 1.0 mm should be used to ensure long-term satisfactory results.

AB  - Mutation in leucine-rich repeat (LRR) kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a common cause ofParkinson's disease (PD). Aberrant LRRK2 kinase activity is associated withdisease pathogenesis and thus it is an attractive drug target for combating PD.Intense efforts in the past nearly two decades have focused on the development ofsmall-molecule inhibitors of the kinase domain of LRRK2 and have identifiedpotent kinase inhibitors. However, most LRRK2 kinase inhibitors have shownadverse effects; therefore, alternative-mechanism-based strategies aredesperately needed. In this review, we discuss the new insights gleaned fromrecent cryoelectron microscope (cryo-EM) structures of LRRK2 towardsunderstanding the mechanisms of actions of LRRK2 and explore the potential newtherapeutic avenues.

AB  - Wheat bran arabinoxylan-bovine serum albumin (WBAX-BSA) conjugates were prepared via enzymatic synthesis using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H2O2 as catalysts.The conjugates were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis),high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The feasibility of its application in stable emulsions was also assessed. UV-vis results revealedthat phenolic acid in WBAX and aromatic amino acids in BSA were implicated in theenzymatic synthesis of the WBAX-BSA conjugate with the optimal WBAX:BSA massratio of 3:2. HPSEC results confirmed the intermolecular interactions betweenWBAX and BSA and the molecular weight of WBAX-BSA (2673 +/- 16 kg/mol) was higherthan that of control groups. Compared with the WBAX/BSA physical complexes, theWBAX-BSA conjugates had higher apparent viscosity (0.08-0.24 Pa.s), denserstructure, larger particle sizes (33.5 +/- 5.7 nm), and improving emulsifyingproperties in oil in water (O/W) emulsion system under different environmentalstresses. The preparation of the enzymatic conjugates not only provides novel O/Wemulsion systems but also improves processed food manufacturing processes thatrequire efficient emulsification.

AB  - A great deal of efforts has been put into studying the influence of the external macroenvironment for activated sludge to survive on microbial communitysuccession, while granular internal spatial microenvironment should be givenequal attention, because it is more directly involved in the information exchangeand material transfer among microorganisms. This study systematicallyinvestigated the effects of granular microenvironment on spatial colonization andcomposition of sludge's core functional flora, and the corresponding differenceof biological treatment performance. High content of extracellular-proteins(67.53 mg/gVSS) or extracellular-polysaccharide (65.02 mg/gVSS) stimulated themicrobial flocculation and aggregation of 0.5-1.5 mm granules (GS) or 1.5-3.0 mm granules (GM), respectively, which was resulted from excellent cellhydrophobicity (59.26%) or viscosity (3.47 mPa s), therefore, constitutedrelatively dense porous frame. More hollow space existed in 3.0-5.0 mm granules(GL), which formed loose skeleton with 0.213 mL/g of total pore volume and 17.21 nm of average pore size. Combining scanning electron microscope images andfluorescent in-situ hybridization based microbiological analysis, aerobicnitrifiers were observed to wrap or surround anaerobic bacteria, orfacultative/anaerobic bacteria were self-encapsulated, which created granule'sunique microenvironment with alternating aerobic and anaerobic zones. GS has the most rich organic matter degrading bacteria and anaerobic heterotrophicdenitrifiers, while GM and GL presented the greatest relative abundance offacultative and aerobic denitrifiers, respectively. The activity of dehydrogenaseand nitrogen invertase of GM showed be 1.32-3.09 times higher than those of GSand GL, contributing to its higher carbon and nitrogen removal. These findingshighlight the importance of granular microenvironment to adaptive regulation ofactivated sludge's core functional flora and corresponding pollutant removalperformance.

AB  - The clinical use of one-retainer RBFDPs in the anterior region has shown highersurvival rates compared to conventional two-retainer RBFDPs. The motivation forthis study was to assess the validity of this observation when extended to theposterior region. The aim was thus to evaluate different preparation andframework designs for replacing premolars, particularly one-retainer versustwo-retainer designs, on the retention of monolithic zirconia posterior RBFDPs.Extracted caries-free human premolars and third molars were embedded inauto-curing resin to create models with an edentulous space of premolar width.Abutment teeth were prepared according to these six designs (n = 8 each): one or two upper retainers with narrow rests, one or two upper retainers with widerests, and one or two-retainers with wide rests. RBFDPs were milled frommonolithic zirconia (KATANA Zirconia HT), and were adhesively bonded usingPanavia V5 with corresponding primers. After thermodynamic loading, thequasi-static tensile force required for failure was determined. Failure modeswere evaluated using a microscope. Survival rates after thermodynamic loadingwere 75% for one group (one upper-molar retainer with narrow rest), 100% for the other groups. The debonding forces ranged from 310 +/- 224 N (group oneupper-molar retainer with narrow rest) to 927 +/- 292 N (group two upperretainers with narrow rests). Two-retainer designs failed at significantly highertensile forces than designs with one retainer (p </= 0.05). There were nosignificant differences between upper and lower designs, or rest widths. AlthoughRBFDPs with two retainers withstood higher debonding forces, RBFDPs with oneretainer and wide rest still have a high potential for clinical treatment becauseof the high forces required for their debonding.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of composition, fabrication mode, and thermalcycling on the mechanical properties of different polymeric systems used fortemporary dental prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard bar-shaped specimens(25 x 2 x 2 mm) were fabricated of six polymeric systems of varying compositions and fabrication modes (n = 10/group): conventional PMMA (Alike, GC) - group CGC; conventional PMMA (Dencor, Classico) - group CD; bis-acryl (Tempsmart, GC) -group BGC; bis-acryl (Yprov, Yller) - group BY; milled PMMA (TelioCAD, Ivoclar) -group MI; 3D printed bis-acryl - (Cosmos Temp, Yller) group PY. Half of thespecimens were subjected to 5000 thermal cycles (5 degrees C to 55 degrees C).Three-point bending tests were performed using a universal testing machine with acrosshead speed set to 0.5 mm/min. Flexural strength and elastic modulus werecalculated from the collected data. FTIR spectra were recorded pre and postcuring and after thermal cycling to evaluate material composition and degree ofconversion. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscope(SEM) were utilized to examine the composition and micromorphology of thesystems, respectively. Data were analyzed using two-analysis of variance andTukey tests (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: FTIR spectra indicated that BGC, BY and PYgroups corresponded to urethane dimethacrylate systems (bis-acryl), while CGC,CD, and MI groups corresponded to monomethacrylate systems, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Bis-acryl BGC system yeilded the highest flexural strength(80 MPa), followed by the milled PMMA MI system (71 MPa), both statisticallysignificant different relative to other groups. Bis-acryl BY exhibited the lowestflexural strength (27 MPa). Thermocycling significantly increased the flexuralstrength of all polymeric systems ( approximately 10-15 MPa), except for the3D-printed PY group. Bis-acryl BGC (1.89 GPa) and conventional PMMA CGC (1.66GPa) groups exhibited the highest elastic modulus, followed by milled PMMA MIgroup (1.51 GPa) and conventional PMMA CD (1.45 GPa) systems, with significantdifference detected between BGC group and MI and CD groups. The 3D printed PY(0.78 GPa) and bis-acryl BY (0.47 GPa) systems presented the lowest elasticmodulus. Thermocycling did not have a significant influence on the elasticmodulus. FTIR spectra indicate water sorption and release of unreacted monomersas well as increased degree of conversion ( approximately 5-12%) after thermalcycling. CONCLUSION: Composition and fabrication mode and thermal cyclingsignificantly affected the mechanical properties of polymeric systems used fortemporary dental prostheses.

TI  - Relationship between gallstones and interstitial cells of Cajal in thegallbladder.
PG  - e29851
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029851 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A high percentage of patients with gallstones exhibit abnormalitiesin gallbladder emptying, and gallstones are often associated with gallbladdercontraction. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the gallbladder are involved inthe generation and spreading of spontaneous contractions of the gallbladder. Thisstudy examined the relationship among the number of gallbladder ICC, gallbladder contractility, and gallstones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients, whounderwent cholecystectomy within 3 months of enduring a gallbladder ejectionfraction scan, were enrolled in this study. ICC were identified using amicroscope after immunohistochemical staining for CD117/c-kit. Five high-powerfield (magnification 400x) units were randomly assigned, and the number of ICC inthe mucosal and muscular layers was counted. These counts were compared accordingto the sex, age, reason for cholecystectomy, presence of gallstone, presence ofgallbladder polyp, gallbladder ejection fraction, and gallbladder size for eachpatient. RESULTS: The number of ICC in the mucosal layer was increased in themale participants (154.4 +/- 73.9) compared with the female participants (107.3+/- 75.2); however, the ICC in the muscular layer was not different between the 2groups. Additionally, the ICC in the mucosal and muscular layers did not differaccording to age, cause of cholecystectomy, number of stones, stone character,stone diameter, or the presence of polyps. A larger gallbladder size wascorrelated with a decreased number of ICC in the muscular layer of thegallbladder. Additionally, when the number of gallbladder stones was increased,the number of ICC in the muscular layer of the gallbladder was decreased;however, there was no significant correlation between the number of ICC in themucosal layer of the gallbladder and any of the following factors: age, GBEF,gallbladder size, stone number, or diameter. Furthermore, there was nosignificant correlation between the number of ICC in the muscular layer of thegallbladder, regardless of age, GBEF, and stone diameter. CONCLUSION: Although wewere unable to achieve significant results regarding the relationship betweenGBEF and ICC, this is the first human study to reveal the relationship among ICC,gallbladder size, and the number of gallstones.

TI  - PET/NIR-II fluorescence imaging and image-guided surgery of glioblastoma using a folate receptor alpha-targeted dual-modal nanoprobe.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05890-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The surgery of glioblastoma (GBM) requires a maximal resection of thetumor when it is safe and feasible. The infiltrating growth property of the GBMmakes it a challenge for neurosurgeons to identify the tumor tissue even with theassistance of the surgical microscope. This highlights the urgent requirement forimaging techniques that can differentiate tumor tissues during surgery in realtime. Fluorescence image-guided surgery of GBM has been investigated usingseveral non-specific fluorescent probes that emit light in the visible and thefirst near-infrared window (NIR-I, 700-900 nm), which limit the detectionaccuracy because of the non-specific targeting mechanism and spectralcharacteristics. Targeted NIR-II (1000-1700 nm) fluorescent probes for GBM arethus highly desired. The folate receptor (FR) has been reported to be upregulatedin GBM, which renders it to be a promising target for specific tumor imaging.METHODS: In this study, the folic acid (FA) that can target the FR was conjugatedwith the clinically approved indocyanine green (ICG) dye and DOTA chelator forradiolabeling with (64)Cu to achieve targeted positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorescence imaging of GBM. RESULTS: Surprisingly it was found that theresulted bioconjugate, DOTA-FA-ICG and non-radioactive (nat)Cu-DOTA-FA-ICG, were both self-assembled into nanoparticles with NIR-II emission signal. Theradiolabeled DOTA-FA-ICG, (64)Cu-DOTA-FA-ICG, was found to specificallyaccumulate in the orthotopic GBM models using in vivo PET, NIR-II, and NIR-Ifluorescence imaging. The best time window of fluorescence imaging wasdemonstrated to be 24 h after DOTA-FA-ICG injection. NIR-II fluorescenceimage-guided surgery was successfully conducted in the orthotopic GBM modelsusing DOTA-FA-ICG. All the fluorescent tissue was removed and proved to be GBM bythe H&E examination. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study demonstrates that the probes,(64)Cu-DOTA-FA-ICG and DOTA-FA-ICG, hold promise for preoperative PET examinationand intraoperative NIR-II fluorescence image-guided surgery of GBM, respectively.

AB  - Quasiperiodicity is a form of spatial order that has been observed inquasicrystalline matter but not light. We construct a quasicrystalline surfaceout of a light emitting diode. Using a nanoscale waveguide as a microscope(NSOM), we directly image the light field at the surface of the diode. Here weshow, using reciprocal space representations of the images, that the light field is quasiperiodic. We explain the structure of the light field with wavesuperposition. Periodic ordering is limited to at most six-fold symmetry. Thelight field exhibits 12-fold quasisymmetry, showing order while disprovingperiodicity. This demonstrates that a new class, consisting of projections fromhyperspace, exists in the taxonomy of light ordering.

TI  - De novo Transcriptome Analysis of Drought-Adapted Cluster Bean (CultivarRGC-1025) Reveals the Wax Regulatory Genes Involved in Drought Resistance.
PG  - 868142
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.868142 [doi]
AB  - Cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L.) is one of the multipurposeunderexplored crops grown as green vegetable and for gum production in drylandareas. Cluster bean is known as relatively tolerant to drought and salinitystress. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the drought toleranceof cluster bean cultivar RGC-1025, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of thedrought-stressed and control samples was performed. De novo assembly of the readsresulted in 66,838 transcripts involving 203 pathways. Among these transcripts,differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis resulted in some of thedrought-responsive genes expressing alpha dioxygenase 2, low temperature-induced 65 kDa protein (LDI65), putative vacuolar amino acid transporter, and lateembryogenesis abundant protein (LEA 3). The analysis also reporteddrought-responsive transcription factors (TFs), such as NAC, WRKY, GRAS, and MYB families. The relative expression of genes by qRT-PCR revealed consistency withthe DEG analysis. Key genes involved in the wax biosynthesis pathway were mapped using the DEG data analysis. These results were positively correlated withepicuticular wax content and the wax depositions on the leaf surfaces, asevidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) image analysis. Further, thesefindings support the fact that enhanced wax deposits on the leaf surface hadplayed a crucial role in combating the drought stress in cluster beans underdrought stress conditions. In addition, this study provided a set of unknowngenes and TFs that could be a source of engineering tolerance against droughtstress in cluster beans.

AB  - Purpose: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Thecombination of paclitaxel (PTX) and carboplatin (CBP) is the first-line remedyfor clinical ovarian cancer. However, due to the limitations of adverse reaction and lacking of targeting ability, the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer is stillpoorly effective. Here, a novel estrone (ES)-conjugated PEGylated liposomeco-loaded PTX and CBP (ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP) was designed for overcoming the above disadvantages. Methods: ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP was prepared by film hydration method and could recognize estrogen receptor (ER) over-expressing on the surface ofSKOV-3 cells. The characterizations, stability and in vitro release ofES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP were studied. In vitro cellular uptake and its mechanism were observed by fluorescence microscope. In vivo targeting effect in tumor-bearingmice was determined. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were studied in ICRmice. In vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy were evaluated onSKOV-3 cells and tumor-bearing mice, respectively. Finally, the acute toxicity inICR mice was explored for assessing the preliminary safety of ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP.Results: Our results showed that ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP was spherical shape withoutaggregation. ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP exhibited the optimum targeting effect on uptake in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP hadimproved the pharmacokinetic behavior. In vitro cytotoxicity showed thatES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP maximally inhibited SKOV-3 cell proliferation and its IC50values was 1.6 times lower than that of non-ES conjugated liposomes at 72 h. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy study demonstrated that ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP could leadstrong SKOV-3 tumor growth suppression with a tumor volume inhibitory rate of81.8%. Meanwhile, acute toxicity studies confirmed that ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBPsignificantly reduced the toxicity of the chemo drugs. Conclusion:ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP was successfully prepared with an optimal physicochemical and ER targeting property. The data of pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor efficacy andsafety study indicated that ES-PEG-Lip-PTX/CBP could become a promisingtherapeutic formulation for human ovarian cancer in the future clinic.

AB  - Introduction: This in-vitro study comprises Antimicrobial and ConfocalMicroscopic analysis of the efficacy of Triple Antibiotic and Toluidine Blue(TBO) loaded chitosan nanoparticles (chnp) activated with photodynamic therapy(PDT) against Enterococcus faecalis (Ef). Methodology: 105 single-rootedextracted teeth were decoronated, cleaned and shaped, and incubated with Ef. The roots were randomly divided into three groups: Group I-Control, Group II-TripleAntibiotic Paste (TAP), Group III: Triple antibiotic-loaded chitosannanoparticles (tachnp), and Group IV: Tachnp and TBO loaded chnp activated withPDT. Ten specimens from all the groups were subjected to antimicrobial analysisand five specimens were observed under the confocal microscope after 24 h and 7days. Group IV was additionally analyzed after 24 h and 7 days of laseractivation. Results: Group IV C showed the least colony-forming units followed byGroup IVB, Group IIIB, Group IVA, and Group IIIA. Group II showed morecolony-forming units. On intergroup comparison of mean colony count in controland experimental groups at 24 h and 7 days using one-way ANOVA F test was highly significant P < 0.001. The confocal microscopic images of IV C showed theincreased intensity of fluorescent red indicating dead bacteria. Conclusion:Within the limitations of this study, TAP loaded chitosan nanoparticles activatedwith PDT showed a significant reduction in colony count.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness ofdifferent irrigation techniques EndoVac, RinsEndo, Canal CleanMax (CCMax),SonicMax, Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation (PUI), and Manual Needle Irrigation (MNI)on dentin erosion and smear layer removal using Scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Materials and Methods: Seventy extracted single-rooted teeth wereinstrumented with ProTaper rotary instruments. The roots were randomly dividedinto six experimental groups (n = 10): EndoVac, RinsEndo, CCMax, SonicMax, PUI,and MNI. Final irrigation was performed with NaOCl followed byethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and NaOCl. Six roots served as control and wereirrigated with only NaOCl. Next, the roots were sectioned in a buccolingualdirection and the halves were examined by SEM. Smear layer and erosion scoreswere recorded in the cervical, middle and apical third of the roots. Dataanalysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests with alevel of significance alpha = 0.05. Results: PUI had the greatest amount of smearlayer compared to other groups (P < 0.001). However, SonicMax had the greatestdegree of erosion compared to RinsEndo, MNI, PUI, and EndoVac groups (P < 0.001) and CCMax group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: RinsEndo and EndoVac techniques left theleast amount of smear layer while causing erosion the least compared to CCMax,PUI, and MNI techniques.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate erbium laser efficiency in removingsmear layer from mesial roots of mandibular first molars at different lasersettings. Subjects and Methods: One hundred (100) mandibular first molars wereselected. Ninety six (96) mesial roots were assigned to two experimental groupsaccording to the laser wavelength applied: I. Er, Cr: YSGG and II. erbium-dopedyttrium aluminum garnet laser system. Four samples were used as control group.Samples of each group were distributed into two subgroups (A and B), followingspecific irrigation protocol. Each subgroup was divided into four subcategoriesaccording to the applied power laser. Each subcategory consisted of six samples. Teeth were observed under scanning electron microscope. Statistical Analysis:Results were statistically analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test(SPSS statistics software). Results: No statistically significant difference was observed between experimental groups I and IotaIota. However, statisticallysignificant difference was found among subgroups IA and IotaB and IotaIA andIotaIotaBeta. In every root third, groups IIA and IotaIotaB had better outcomesbut it was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference among subcategories of Group I (IotaAlpha1-4 and IotaBeta1-4) andGroup IotaIota (IotaIotaAlpha1-4 and IotaIotaBeta1-4). Conclusion: Erbium laserwith tested parameters did not completely remove the smear layer from the rootcanals. Chelating factors can contribute in the laser mechanism of smear layerremoval from apical part of narrow and curved root canals.

PG  - 1850-1860
LID - 10.21037/tcr-22-364 [doi]
AB  - Background: NUT carcinoma (NC) is a rapidly progressing and rare neoplasm thatprimarily affects younger patients and has a survival time of about 1 year. Most of these neoplasms express epithelial markers with no neuroendocrine markersobserved. Retrospective studies have shown that pathologists and clinicians donot have a sufficient understanding of the disease due to the lack of commonclinical manifestations, imaging, and morphological features. Case Description: A60-year-old female presented at Beijing Friendship Hospital, showing repetitiveepistaxis, nasal pain, and nasal congestion with obvious masses in the rightnasal sinus and frontal sinus. Microscope analysis revealed two uniquemorphological changes which have not been previously reported in the existingliterature: (I) small spindle cells with sparse cytoplasm and densely stainednuclei and (II) large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm, some cells resembling plasma cells. The sudden appearance of keratinization was also a prominentfeature. Immunohistochemical staining showed differences between the two cellmorphologies. Small spindle cells simultaneously expressed CK5/6 and P40, and theKi67 proliferation index was 40%. The large round cells did not express CK5/6 andP40 but were focal positive for synaptophysin and the Ki67 index was 10%. NUT andP63 were strongly expressed in both cell types and fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) revealed BRD4-NUTM1 translocation. Following 20 rounds ofpostoperative radiation treatment, the patient was alive and no recurrence ormetastasis was observed during a 5-month follow-up. Conclusions: We present novelinformation from the oldest known and surviving patient of NC originating in the nasal cavity with unique morphological features and different immunohistochemicalresults. NUT antibody testing should be performed in undifferentiated or poorlydifferentiated malignancies, particularly those with either or both cytoplasmicvacuolation of medium-sized cells and abrupt keratinization, irrespective ofpatient age.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.25858 [doi]
AB  - Access to microneurosurgical care in low- and middle-income countries remainslimited mainly due to a lack of equipment. High purchasing and maintenance costs hinder the use of operating microscopes in low-resource facilities. The authorspresent an improved version of their previously introduced low-cost exoscope toachieve high magnification and illumination in low-resource environments. Thesetup included a 48-megapixel two-dimensional digital microscope camera, a widefield C-mount lens, ring light, and a two-link cantilever with a screw terminal. The surgical field was projected to a portable 17.3-inch 2K resolution monitor.Ten patients underwent exoscope-assisted transforaminal lumbar interbody fusionvia the Wiltse paraspinal approach. The simple construction allowed a fast andintuitive preoperative setup. The in-plane switching type display provided aclear and bright image regardless of the viewing angle. The two-link arm of thecantilever allowed smooth positioning of the camera, overcoming the cumbersome upand down movements needed to zoom in and out with the previous prototype.Industrial microscope cameras are effective low-budget alternatives toconventional operating microscopes in lumbar microdiscectomy. The improved systemis superior compared to the authors' previous prototype with regard toaffordability, image quality, and adjustability of position and angle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits (GFND) is a rare autosomaldominant genetic disorder, and proteinuria and hematuria are the most commonclinical manifestations. The pathogenesis of this disease is primarily related tomutation of the fibronectin 1 gene. Unfortunately, without specific treatment,the prognosis remains poor. Here we present a case report that investigates theclinical characteristics, renal pathology, and gene testing of childhood GFND.CASE PRESENTATION: A two-year-old child was brought to our hospital for"persistent hematuria for 1 year and 10 months." The disease onset was at the ageof 4 months, with persistent microscopic hematuria accompanied by intermittentgross hematuria, occasionally with proteinuria, and without hypertension or renalfailure. The chief complaint was intermittent gross hematuria, without massiveproteinuria, hypertension, or renal failure. Family history: The child's motherhad microscopic hematuria, his maternal aunt had nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and his maternal grandmother had end-stage renaldisease. No significant pathological changes were found in the renal pathologicalbiopsy of the child under a light microscope. Under the electron microscope, the basement membrane was found to be of uneven thickness, ranging from 150 to 400nm. The stratum compactum of the basement membrane was thickened, with a smallpart showing tear-like and cobweb-like morphology. No electron-dense depositswere found. The renal tubular epithelial cells were vacuolated, and there were nounique pathological changes in the renal interstitium. Immunofluorescence showed that IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q were all negative. Alport syndrome waspreliminarily considered. However, exome sequencing revealed a mutated site inthe fibronectin 1 gene. The child's mother was the carrier of the pathogenic geneand the final diagnosis was GFND. CONCLUSIONS: Fibronectin deposition is atypical pathological change in GFND, and the disease progresses slowly toend-stage renal disease. There is no specific treatment so far, and the prognosisis poor. The early onset of childhood patients may not show typical renalpathological changes, but only changes in the thickness of basement membrane,etc. Genome sequencing technology may helpful for the early diagnosis of GFND.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eimeria spp. are coccidian protozoan parasites of domestic and wildanimals. Pelecaniform birds are hosts of some Eimeria spp., however, from thefamily Threskiornithidae only one eimerian species is recorded, Eimeria baziChauhan et Bhatia, 1970 which was described from red-naped ibises Pseudibispapillosa (Temminck, 1824) in India. In this study, in turn, this species ismorphologically and molecularly identified from buff-necked ibises Theristicuscaudatus (Boddaert, 1783) in Brazil. PURPOSE: This study aimed to report E. bazi from buff-necked ibises T. caudatus in southeastern Brazil, revealing theworldwide distribution of this coccidian species, in addition to providingpreliminary genotypic identification via sequencing of the mitochondrialcytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene. METHODS: A total of 73 fecal sampleswere collected from a flock of buff-necked ibises, which remained on the campusof the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro-UFRRJ) from March 2019 to August 2020. Fecal samples wereprocessed by the Sheather's method to recover oocysts. The morphological andmorphometrical studies of the oocysts were performed using an optical microscope and graphic editing software. Molecular analysis was performed by sequencing ofthe COI gene, and the phylogenetic analysis was based in the neighbor-joining andmaximum likelihood estimates. RESULTS: Forty-five fecal samples were positive foroocysts identified as E. bazi. This oocysts are ovoidal, 26.2 x 18.9 mum, withsmooth to slightly rough wall, c.1.7 mum thick. Micropyle robust and protruding, sometimes with a polar body attached. Oocyst residuum absent, but one or twosmall polar granules are present. Sporocysts ovoidal to lemon-shaped, 14.2 x 8.7 mum. The Stieda body is knob-like to rounded and sub-Stieda body is absent orvestigial. Sporocyst residuum is composed of granules often membrane-bound.Sporozoites are vermiform, with refractile bodies. This morphology was consistentwith the original description of E. bazi from P. papillosa in India. Molecularanalysis at the COI gene exhibited low similarity with coccidians sequenced forthe same genic region deposited in GenBank, sitting E. bazi separately on thecladogram. CONCLUSIONS: The morphological and molecular studies support theidentification of E. bazi from T. caudatus in South America, thus revealing thewide distribution of this eimerian species in the world provided by migratorybirds and/or with intercontinental distribution.

AB  - Proteins play an important part in almost all life activities and across allorganisms. Proteins occasionally act on their own but rather fulfill most oftheir biological tasks by cooperating with other proteins or ligand molecules.The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay serves to measuredynamic events such as protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions in vitro orin-vivo. With several inherent attributes such as rapid and fairly sensitiveratio-metric measurements, assessment of interactions irrespective of proteinlocation within the cellular compartment, cost-effectiveness consenting tohigh-throughput screening compatibility, makes BRET a popular geneticreporter-based assay system for protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies. Based on the Forster principle, BRET allows to judge if the proximity has been achievedbetween the interacting partners. In recent years, the BRET application hasemerged as a significantly versatile assay format by using multiple detectiondevices such as a plate reader or in-vivo optical imaging platform, or even abioluminescence microscope has expanded its scope for advancing PPI studies.Beyond the scope of quantitative measurement of PPIs, molecular optical imagingapplications based on BRET assay have expanded the scope for screeningpharmacological compounds by unifying live cell and in-vivo animal-/plant-basedexperiments using the same platform technology. In this chapter, we have givenintricate methodological details for performing in-vitro and in-vivo BRETexperiments, primarily by using donor/acceptor reporter protein combinations.

TI  - A computational approach to quantifying miscounting of radiation-induceddouble-strand break immunofluorescent foci.
PG  - 700
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03585-5 [doi]
AB  - Immunofluorescent tagging of DNA double-strand break (DSB) markers, such asgamma-H2AX and other DSB repair proteins, are powerful tools in understandingbiological consequences following irradiation. However, whilst the technique iswidespread, there are many uncertainties related to its ability to resolve andreliably deduce the number of foci when counting using microscopy. We present anew tool for simulating radiation-induced foci in order to evaluate microscopeperformance within in silico immunofluorescent images. Simulations of the DSBdistributions were generated using Monte Carlo track-structure simulation. Foreach DSB distribution, a corresponding DNA repair process was modelled and theun-repaired DSBs were recorded at several time points. Corresponding microscopyimages for both a DSB and (gamma-H2AX) fluorescent marker were generated andcompared for different microscopes, radiation types and doses. Statisticallysignificant differences in miscounting were found across most of the testedscenarios. These inconsistencies were propagated through to repair kinetics wherethere was a perceived change between radiation-types. These changes did notreflect the underlying repair rate and were caused by inconsistencies in focicounting. We conclude that these underlying uncertainties must be considered whenanalysing images of DNA damage markers to ensure differences observed are realand are not caused by non-systematic miscounting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) is aneffective procedure for lumbar spine diseases. The procedure can be done using a surgical microscope (SM) or surgical loupes (SL) magnification. However, thereare no studies that compared outcomes between using these 2 magnifying devices inthe MIS-TLIF procedure. The purpose of this study was to compare clinicaloutcomes, perioperative complications, and radiographic parameters of MIS-TLIFusing SM compared with SL magnification. METHODS: We included all patientsundergoing 1-level MIS-TLIF between January 2017 and December 2019. Type ofmagnification (SM vs SL), operative time, blood loss, perioperativecomplications, cross-sectional area of the spinal canal, and fusion rates wereanalyzed. Clinical outcomes measurement using the visual analog scale (VAS) andOswestry Disability Index (ODI) were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of100 patients had underwent MIS-TLIF (SM group: 62; SL group: 38). Operative time (SM: 182.7 +/- 41.5 vs SL: 165.6 +/- 32.6 minutes, P = 0.043) was significantlyshorter in the SL group, with a mean difference of 17.2 minutes and a 10.4%increase in operative time between SL and SM. Blood loss (SM: 187.4 +/- 176.4 vs SL: 215.6 +/- 99.4 mL, P = 0.36) was not different between groups, with a meandifference of 28.2 mL. Both the SM group and SL group demonstrated no significantdifferences in improvement from baseline in VAS back, VAS legs, ODI score, andcross-sectional area of the spinal canal. There was also no significantdifference in complication rates and fusion rates between groups. CONCLUSIONS:Our study found no difference between intraoperative use of SL compared with SMin clinical outcomes through the 12-month follow-up timepoint. However, the useof SM resulted in an increased average operative time of 17 minutes compared withthe SL group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intraoperative use of SM and SL magnificationin MIS-TLIF provides similar outcomes except prolonged operative time in the SMgroup. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3:

AB  - Abundant cellulose and insoluble protein were contained in the Se-enriched peanutleaf residue, a by-product from leaf protein extraction. Ionic liquids (ILs) wereused to extract the cellulose-protein complexes (CPCs) from Se-enriched peanutleaf residue. The effects of various ILs as extractants and organic solvents asregenerant on the physicochemical properties of CPCs were compared. The resultsshowed that the yield of CPCs and recovery yield of [AMIM]Cl(1-allyl-3-methylimidazole chloride) were better than those of [BMIM]Cl(1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride). Simultaneously, it could be seen from theinfrared absorption peaks and secondary structure fitting results that [BMIM]Clseemed stronger than [AMIM]Cl in destroying the secondary structure of CPCs.Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the CPCs extracted by [BMIM]Clwere lamellate with holes on the surface, and the CPCs extracted by [AMIM]Cl wererough, almost without holes on the surface. Furthermore, the transmittance andtensile strength of the film which contained BA-CPC ([BMIM]Cl as extractant andacetonitrile as regenerant) film were better than those contained AA-CPC([AMIM]Cl as extractant and acetonitrile as regenerant) film, which might bemainly because the types of ILs and regenerants affect the particle size of CPCs,thereby influencing the mechanical properties of the film.

TI  - Using Simulated Training Data of Voxel-Level Generative Models to Improve 3DNeuron Reconstruction.
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3191011 [doi]
AB  - Reconstructing neuron morphologies from fluorescence microscope images plays acritical role in neuroscience studies. It relies on image segmentation to produceinitial masks either for further processing or final results to representneuronal morphologies. This has been a challenging step due to the variation and complexity of noisy intensity patterns in neuron images acquired frommicroscopes. Whereas progresses in deep learning have brought the goal ofaccurate segmentation much closer to reality, creating training data forproducing powerful neural networks is often laborious. To overcome the difficultyof obtaining a vast number of annotated data, we propose a novel strategy ofusing two-stage generative models to simulate training data with voxel-levellabels. Trained upon unlabeled data by optimizing a novel objective function ofpreserving predefined labels, the models are able to synthesize realistic 3Dimages with underlying voxel labels. We showed that these synthetic images could train segmentation networks to obtain even better performance than manuallylabeled data. To demonstrate an immediate impact of our work, we further showedthat segmentation results produced by networks trained upon synthetic data could be used to improve existing neuron reconstruction methods.

TI  - Types of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for cancer diagnosis: a review.
LID - 10.1007/s10103-022-03610-3 [doi]
AB  - Cancer is a life-threatening disease that has claimed the lives of many peopleworldwide. With the current diagnostic methods, it is hard to determine cancer atan early stage, due to its versatile nature and lack of genomic biomarkers. Therapid development of biophotonics has emerged as a potential tool in cancerdetection and diagnosis. Using the fluorescence, scattering, and absorptioncharacteristics of cells and tissues, it is possible to detect cancer at an earlystage. The diagnostic techniques addressed in this review are highly sensitive tothe chemical and morphological changes in the cell and tissue during diseaseprogression. These changes alter the fluorescence signal of the cell/tissue andare detected using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques including confocal and two-photon fluorescence (TPF). Further, second harmonic generation (SHG)microscopy reveals the morphological changes that occurred in non-centrosymmetricstructures in the tissue, such as collagen. Again, Raman spectroscopy is anon-destructive method that provides a fingerprinting technique to differentiate benign and malignant tissue based on Raman signal. Photoacoustic microscopy andspectroscopy of tissue allow molecule-specific detection with high spatialresolution and penetration depth. In addition, terahertz spectroscopic studiesreveal the variation of tissue water content during disease progression. In this review, we address the applications of spectroscopic and microscopic techniquesfor cancer detection based on the optical properties of the tissue. The discussedstate-of-the-art techniques successfully determines malignancy to its rapiddiagnosis.

LID - 10.1007/s10266-022-00729-1 [doi]
AB  - This study, in which a hundred human teeth with single straight canal were used, focused on the evaluation of contrast solution penetration ability into thesimulated lateral canals activated by XP-endo Finisher (XPF), EDDY, Nd:YAG, andEr:YAG laser systems with three different observation methods. The root canalswere prepared up to X4 at working length using the ProTaper Next system. Theteeth were decalcified and simulated lateral canals were created with #8 K-fileat 2, 4, and 6 mm levels. Then the teeth were cleared using methyl salicylate anddivided into 5 equal groups according to irrigation activation techniques (CSI,XPF, EDDY, Nd:YAG, and Er:YAG laser). After the contrast solution was activated, images of the simulated lateral canals were obtained by a dental microscope,digital radiography, and CBCT. The contrast solution penetration scores at the 2,4, and 6 mm levels according to irrigation activation techniques and observation methods were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance Bonferroni test post hoc comparisons. With the other 2 parameters areignored, the highest and lowest contrast solution penetration were observed at 6 and 2 mm simulated lateral canal levels (p < 0.05), in Er:YAG irrigationactivation and CSI technique (p < 0.05), and in direct visual and digitalradiographic observation method (p < 0.05), respectively. Within the limits ofthis study, it was determined that the contrast solution penetration into thesimulated lateral canals decreased from the coronal to the apical and achievedwith the most effective Er:YAG laser activation technique. In addition, directvisual observation was found to be the best method for the assessment of contrastsolution penetration.

TI  - Polystyrene nanoplastics exacerbated lipopolysaccharide-induced necroptosis andinflammation via the ROS/MAPK pathway in mice spleen.
LID - 10.1002/tox.23618 [doi]
AB  - Plastics are novel environmental pollutants with potential threats to theecosystem. At least 5.25 trillion plastic particles in the environment, of which nanoplastics are <100 nm in diameter. Polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) exposure damaged the spleen's immune function. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced othertoxicants to damage cells and organs, triggering inflammation. However, themechanism of PS-NPs aggravated LPS-induced spleen injury remains unclear. In thisstudy, the PS-NPs or/and LPS mice exposure model was replicated byintraperitoneal injection of PS-NPs or/and LPS, and PS-NPs or/and LPS wereexposed to RAW264.7 cells. The histopathological and ultrastructural changes ofthe mice spleen were observed by H&E staining and transmission electronmicroscope. Western Blot, qRT-PCR, and fluorescent probes staining were used todetect reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress indicators, inflammatoryfactors, and necroptosis-related indicators in mice spleen and RAW264.7 cells.The results showed that PS-NPs or LPS induced oxidative stress, activated theMAPK pathway, and eventually caused necroptosis and inflammation in mice spleenand RAW264.7 cells. Compared with the single treatment group, the changes inPS-NPs + LPS group were more obvious. Furthermore, ROS inhibitorN-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited the activation of themitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway caused by co-treatment of PS-NPs and LPS, reducing necroptosis and inflammation. The resultsdemonstrated that PS-NPs promoted LPS-induced spleen necroptosis and inflammationin mice through the ROS/MAPK pathway. This study increases the data on the damageof PS-NPs to the organism and expands the research ideas and clues.

TI  - Palm-based cellulose nanofiber isolated from mechano-chemical processing assustainable rheological modifier in reduced fat mayonnaise.
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.16250 [doi]
AB  - Reducing fat intake from our daily diet serves to be an effective way to combatthe rising obesity issue worldwide. Hence, reducing fat content in mayonnaise, a high fat food product, is one of the primary trends in the food industry. Todate, research on the use of nanocellulose, a new and emerging form of fatmimetic, in mayonnaise formulation remains limited. This study sets out toformulate reduced fat 5%, 15%, and 30% mayonnaise using varying concentration of nanocellulose synthesized from palm pressed fiber followed by a 20-day stability study. Nanocellulose was synthesized with particle size of 106.0 +/- 18.7 nm and zeta potential of -72.5 +/- 2.26 mV. It was used as fat mimetic in mayonnaise.Rheological analysis conducted showed that incorporation of nanocellulose intoreduced fat mayonnaise formulation was able to counteract the loss of viscosityin mayonnaise caused by fat content reduction. This finding was further supportedby the smaller oil droplets that are closely packed in reduced fat mayonnaiseformulation when viewed under light microscope. Nonetheless, significant oildroplet coalescence was found in reduced fat mayonnaise formulations duringstorage period which could lead to loss of viscosity. Taken together, thesefindings suggest that CNF was able to act as fat mimetic upon formulation ofmayonnaise but the same cannot be said during long term storage of mayonnaise.PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We successfully isolated nanocellulose from palm biomass(palm pressed fiber) using green approach and used it as a fat replacer forpreparation of 5%, 15%, and 30% reduced fat mayonnaise. A computation studyrevealed a strong binding affinity of the nanocellulose on the lipase active siteessential to inhibit the digestion of fats and oils. Therefore, nanocellulosedemonstrated a huge potential to be used as not only as fat replacer but alsorheological modifier for the development of reduced fat or vegan foods.

AB  - This study aims to ensure the wide application of ultrasound-guided superiorbrachial plexus block in shoulder surgery, solve the application problem ofultrasound-guided superior brachial plexus block in shoulder surgery, make up forsevere postoperative pain after shoulder arthroscopy, and improve the patient'srecovery ability. In this paper, 90 patients with shoulder arthroscopy weredivided into 3 groups: A, B, and C. In recent years, with the rapid developmentof medicine, ultrasound-guided brachial plexus upper trunk block has been widely used in shoulder surgery. Shoulder arthroscopy is more and more used in thediagnosis and treatment of shoulder diseases because of its advantages ofminimally invasive, safe, and rapid recovery. Compared with the traditionaloperation, it is found that the shoulder arthroscopic operation reduces theincision trauma through the microscope, but the shoulder operation involves more muscles and ligaments, so the perioperative pain of shoulder arthroscopicoperation is still serious.

LID - 10.1155/2022/3257377 [doi]
AB  - Background: Understanding oral aspects of pathology by traditional techniques hasalways been a paradigm in the field of dental education. Traditional methods ofteaching include interaction using black board, projectors, and alternate methodsof teaching such as a student-centered approach where live-field demonstrations, audio visual aids, and student interaction are also gaining importance,ultimately promoting active education. The aim of the study was to comparelive-field and static-field teaching methods in understanding and retention ofthe histopathological features in dental students. Methods: This was across-sectional analytical study, wherein a uniform cohort of III-year dentalstudents was obtained by randomizing the study subjects. Practical classes wereconducted using traditional black board/static pictures and dynamic live-fieldteaching comprising of microscope connected to an HD screen and projectordemonstrating the preferred microscopic field. Alternately, the level ofretention of knowledge was measured using customized topic-based tests. Thecomparison of average scores was done between live-field and static-fieldteaching groups using the paired t-test. Results: The test scores using thepaired t-test were marginally elevated in the conventional mode of teaching;however, it varied with respect to precise topics taken using both the genres of teaching. Conclusion: A balance of both conventional and virtual teaching needsto be achieved to enhance the comprehension in student learning. Nevertheless, inthe impending years, advanced research is entailed to see if the virtual mode of teaching could replace the conventional method for the advancement in the studyprospects.

AB  - Patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer who undergo an axillarydissection and require adjuvant therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy are at high risk of developing lymphedema of the associated extremity. Historically, patients with lymphedema were treated with ablative procedures aimed simply toremove excess fluid and adiposity; however, the field of lymphatic surgeryemploying super-microsurgery techniques has witnessed tremendous advances in arelatively short period of time. Advancements in surgical instruments, microscopemagnification and optics, imaging technology, and surgeon experience have usheredin a new era of hope to treat patients suffering from breast cancer-relatedlymphedema (BCRL). Here we aim to present the available options for patientssuffering from BCRL, and the pinnacle in reconstruction and restoration for thesepatients.

AB  - Based on the knowledge of the previous film, the CT scan was used to diagnose thedisease of women and men after the diagnosis of atherosclerosis by scanning theCT microscope. This article first examines the existing medical procedures inChina, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of various systems in terms of usability and user experience. Combined with the actual needs of hospitals,this paper developed a set of preoperative intelligent measurement system (MIPS) based on pattern recognition for total skeletal joint replacement. It isbeneficial for doctors to better observe the lesions of patients before surgeryand carry out necessary operations in the PATIENT DR film. In the process, themodel is used to identify the patient, and the patient is given a fake scorebased on the characteristics of the DR film. In nonsymptomatic patients, 13.5%had muscle contraction > 50%, 2.0% had muscle contraction 70%, and the meanpelvic area was 23.48%. The left ventricular muscle has a 45.0% contraction rate,the left ventricle has a 70% contraction, and the median contraction rate is47.58%. The right muscle, which is inserted between the right artery and theinner lymphatic artery, is the most common type of compression of the rightmuscle, accounting for 59.26%. In terms of the mean muscle contraction rate onthe right side, patients with DVT with right muscles were higher than patientswith DVT with left ventricles (48.54% to 22.29%, P < 0.001). The mean incidenceof left ventricular DVT patients was higher than that of right ventricular DVTpatients (71.88% versus 45.83% P < 0.0011).

TI  - Observations on the cytomorphology and ultrastructure of the peripheral bloodcells of native cattle (Zobawng) of Mizoram, India.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24197 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to characterize the cytomorphology and ultrastructure of bloodcells of native cattle of Mizoram. Twelve numbers of blood samples (10 ml) werecollected from the Zobawng cattle, irrespective of sex. Blood smears wereprepared and stained with different stains for cytomorphological study. Thestandard protocol has been followed for preparing blood samples for electronmicroscopy. Under a light microscope, erythrocytes of cattle were non-nucleatedand round. The neutrophils were round, and the cytoplasm contained cytoplasmicgranules. The eosinophils were rounded in outline with distinct cytoplasmicgranules. The presence of basophils was infrequent with distinct blue colorcytoplasmic granules. Small, medium, and large types of lymphocytes wererecorded. The monocytes were round to oval in outline. Platelets were irregularto round. The reticulocytes were recorded occasionally, like small blue thin rodsor granules. The cytoplasm and nucleus of granulocytes fluoresced greenish-yellowand red, respectively, with supravital stain. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the erythrocytes appeared as biconcave discs. Different leukocytes wereobserved with their finger-like, plate-like, and narrow cell processes on theirsurface. Platelets were irregular structures. In transmission electron microscopy(TEM), the erythrocytes appeared anucleated biconcave elongated, neutrophils wereroughly rounded with small cytoplasmic processes, and eosinophils were roughlycircular with small cytoplasmic processes, the basophils were roughly circularwith oval to elongated cytoplasmic granules, lymphocytes were roughly circularwith centrally placed well-marked oval indented nucleus and some cytoplasmicprocesses, monocytes appeared spherical with long thick cytoplasmic processes andthe non-nucleated platelets appeared roughly round to elongated.

TI  - Remineralization and protection from demineralization: effects of ahydroxyapatite-containing, a fluoride-containing and a fluoride- andhydroxyapatite-free toothpaste on human enamel in vitro.
PG  - 26

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the remineralization potential as well as theextent of protection against renewed demineralization of enamel byhydroxyapatite-containing toothpaste (Karex) in comparison to fluoride-containing(Elmex) and fluoride- and hydroxyapatite-free toothpaste (Ajona) as control.METHODS: Fifty-seven enamel samples were obtained from 19 human teeth. Fivedemarcated surfaces were created on each tooth (S0-S4). Four of the surfaces(S1-S4) were exposed to lactic acid (pH 3) for 8 h (demineralization). S0 wasleft untreated as control. S1 was solely treated with acid. Afterdemineralization, S2 was exposed to Karex for 2 min, of which 15 s were brushing.S3 was treated with Elmex and S4 with Ajona, accordingly. Then, the samples were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope and ImageJ image analysis softwareto determine the percentage of demineralization. Afterwards, S2-S4 were againexposed to lactic acid for 2 h, and subjected to pixel analysis another time.Data were statistically analysed using ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe test and theKurskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The surfaces treated with Elmex showed the lowestpercentage of demineralization (mean 5.01 +/- 0.98%) (p < 0.01). Thus, Elmexremineralized more effectively compared to Ajona (8.89 +/- 1.41%) and Karex (9.85+/- 1.63%) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, Elmex showed the lowest percentage ofdemineralized enamel after new demineralization (median 6.29%), followed by Ajona(11.92%) and Karex (13.46%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In terms of remineralizationand protection against renewed demineralization, a hydroxyapatite-containingtoothpaste (Karex) appears to be inferior to a fluoride-containing toothpaste(Elmex) and a fluoride- and hydroxyapatite-free toothpaste (Ajona). Hence, therecommendation to use Karex to protect against demineralization should becritically questioned.

TI  - Bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, effectively alleviate allergicrhinitis via suppression of PI3K-PKB activity.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-022-07538-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the therapeutic effect of Bicalutamide, an androgenreceptor antagonist on the onset and development of allergic rhinitis in ananimal model. METHODS: 40 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups(eight mice per group). Aluminum hydroxide powder was used as an adjuvant,combined with Ovalbumin (OVA) to establish the mouse model of allergic rhinitisvia ultrasonic nebulization of OVA to stimulate the nasal cavity. Mice in Bica#1 group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.02 mg Bicalutamide/0.5 ml of normal saline daily for 7 consecutive days; mice in Bica#2 group were administered 0.02 mg Bicalutamide/0.5 ml of normal saline via intraperitoneal injection for 5consecutive days, and then the same amount of normal saline was injectedintraperitoneally for 2 consecutive days. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wasadopted to detect the serological levels of IgE, IL-4, and IL-6 production.Eosinophil infiltration was observed under microscope after hematoxylin and eosinstaining of nasal mucosa. Quantitative PCR and Western blot were employed fordetermination of histamine receptors mRNA expression and PI3K/PKB associatedprotein levels, respectively. RESULTS: Histological analysis shown that allergic lesion was induced after OVA sensitization. Intraperitoneal injection with 0.02mg Bicalutamide daily for 7 consecutive days significantly reduced the allergiclesion; however, mice injected with the same amount of normal saline at the same time demonstrated no allergic rhinitis symptoms. In addition, there was asignificant reduction in eosinophils number in Bicalutamide treated mice (n = 8) compared to the OVA group (n = 8) (OVA: 19.6 +/- 5.3 vs. Bica#1: 7.7 +/- 0.8 vs. Bica#2: 9.4 +/- 1.2, both p < 0.01). Furthermore, ELISA results revealed that theserological levels of IgE (OVA: 17.3 +/- 1.7 microg/ml vs. Bica#1: 9.2 +/- 0.6vs. Bica#2: 10.4 +/- 2.3, both p < 0.05), IL-4 (OVA: 164.3 +/- 5.1 pg/ml vs.Bica#1: 110.2 +/- 3.1 vs. Bica#2: 115.3 +/- 4.1, both p < 0.05) and IL-6 (OVA:167.3 +/- 3.7 pg/ml vs. Bica#1: 117.5 +/- 6.5 vs. Bica#2: 114.8 +/- 2.4, both p <0.05) were significantly decreased after two different dosage of Bicalutamidetreatment. Similarly, histamine receptors in mast cells were significantlyreduced after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment. More importantly,p-PKB protein was notably reduced after two different dosage of Bicalutamidetreatment compared to the OVA group, mTOR protein levels were also down regulatedafter two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our datademonstrated that androgen receptor antagonist Bicalutamide can significantlyalleviate allergic rhinitis lesion in the animal model. PI3K/PKB activity in mastcells was suppressed after Bicalutamide injection. Our results provide important implication in allergic rhinitis prevention and treatment.

AB  - The process of encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles using a graphene layer ismainly direct pyrolysis. The encapsulation structure of hybrids prepared in this way improves the catalyst stability, which greatly reduces the leaching ofnon-metals and prevents metal nanoparticles from growing beyond a certain size.In this study, cobalt particles surrounded by graphene layers were formed byincreasing the temperature in a transmission electron microscope, and they wereanalyzed using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Synthesizedcobalt hydroxide nanosheets were used to obtain cobalt particles using an in-situheating holder inside a TEM column. The cobalt nanoparticles are surrounded bylayers of graphene, and the number of layers increases as the temperatureincreases. The interlayer spacing of the graphene layers was also investigatedusing atomic imaging. The success achieved in the encapsulation of metallicnanoparticles in graphene layers paves the way for the design of highly activeand reusable heterogeneous catalysts for more challenging molecules.

LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/ac80cb [doi]
AB  - Spinel Co3O4nanospheres have been synthesized by the microwave-assistedhydrothermal method. The N-doped graphene nanosheets (NGN) were synthesized usingHummer's method. The prepared spinel Co3O4and NGN were mixed under certainproportions using an ultrasonication process and treated with microwave radiationto prepare a novel spinel Co3O4nanospheres infused NGN. The synthesized sampleswere characterized by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Zetasizer, scanning electron microscope/transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectronspectroscopy for identifying crystal structure and phase, particle size, and the morphology of the nanostructure and the elemental configuration, respectively.The prepared spinel Co3O4/NGN were used as anode material and lithium metal as a reference electrode to fabricate half cell using Swagelok cell components. Theelectrochemical properties were studied and found to exhibit a larger specificcapacity of 575 mAh g(-1)compared to traditional graphite electrodes, after 100cycles under 0.1 C rate with a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%. Thegood electrochemical properties ascribe to the distinctive surface morphological nanostructures of nanoporous nanospheres of spinel Co3O4nanospheres andnanosheets of N-doped graphene that reduce the lithium-ion diffusion pathway. Thedeveloped anode material would be a potential electrode for lithium ion batteryapplications.

TI  - Photoluminescent and photochromic smart window from recycled polyester reinforcedwith cellulose nanocrystals.
LID - 10.1002/bio.4333 [doi]
AB  - Smart windows with long-persistent phosphorescence, ultraviolet (UV) lightprotection, high transparency, and high rigidity were developed by easilyimmobilizing varying ratios of lanthanide-activated aluminate phosphor nanoscale particles within a composite of recycled polyester/cellulose nanocrystals(RPET/CNC). Cellulose nanocrystals were prepared from rice straw waste. Cellulosenanocrystals were used at low concentration as both crosslinker and drier toimprove both transparency and hardness. The phosphor nanoscale particles must be distributed into the recycled polyester/cellulose nanocrystals composite bulkwithout agglomeration to produce transparent RPET/CNC substrates.Photoluminescence characteristics were also studied using spectroscopic profiles of excitation/emission and decay/lifetime. The hardness efficiency was alsoexamined. This transparent recycled polyester waste/cellulose nanocrystalsnanocomposite smart window has been shown to change colour under UV light tostrong green and to greenish-yellow when it is dark, as proved by CommissionInternationale de l'eclairage (CIE) laboratory colour parameters. It was foundthat the afterglow RPET/CNC smart window had phosphorescence intensities of 428, 493, and 523 nm upon excitation at 368 nm. There was evidence of improved UVshielding, photostability, and hydrophobic activity. In the presence of a lowphosphor ratio, the luminescent RPET/CNC substrates showed quick and reversiblefluorescence photochromic activity when exposed to UV radiation.

AB  - This ex vivo study evaluates the incidence of sinus membrane perforation duringimplant site osteotomy with two different types of drills and drillingtechniques. Fifty goat heads with 50 sinus pairs (100 sinus sides) were assigned to two groups (osseodensification bur [OB] group and inverse conical shape bur[ICSB] group) to simulate transcrestal sinus elevation (50 sinus sides pergroup). An osteotomy was performed to pass through the lateral sinus wall no morethan 3 mm. The integrity of the sinus membranes was examined and confirmed under a microscope. Of the 50 sinuses per group, the OB group presented with 14 (28%)perforated sinuses, while the ICSB group presented with 2 (4%) perforatedsinuses. Of the 14 perforations from the OB group, 6 (42.9%) showed a pinpointperforation pattern, 4 (28.5%) of which were not visible until direct airpressure was applied. Overall, the ICSB drill group demonstrated a lower sinusperforation rate than the OB group.

AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized from the leaf extract of Brassicaoleracea L. Acephala group (collard green) followed by their characterizationusing Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). The antibacterial properties of zinc nanoparticles were tested against Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC (R) 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC (R)8739), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC(R) BAA-1705) and Gram-positive bacteria,Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC (R) 6538) and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC (R)13932), at four different concentrations (50.00 microg/ml, 100.00 microg/ml,500.00 microg/ml and 1 mg/ml) of zinc oxide nanoparticles suspension. Resultsrevealed that the synthesized nanoparticles exhibit strong antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia,Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at 500.00 microg/ml-1 mg/mlconcentrations. An increase in efficacy of nanoparticles with the decrease oftheir size was also evident. This is a first ever report on Brassica oleracea, L.based nanoparticles which demonstrates that 500.00 microg-1 mg/ml conc. of zincoxide nanoparticles have antibacterial activity against both Gram -ve and Gram+ve bacteria and have the potential to be considered as an antibacterial agent infuture.

TI  - Application of Bentonite Clay, Date Pit, and Chitosan Nanoparticles as Promising Adsorbents to Sequester Toxic Lead and Cadmium from Milk.
LID - 10.1007/s12011-022-03353-w [doi]
AB  - Evaluating residual lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) levels in food products,especially milk, is critical for product safety and quality. In this purview, thecurrent study aims to determine Pb and Cd concentrations in milk using atomicabsorption spectrophotometry and compare their values with internationalstandards. In addition, it aims to remove these metals from milk samples usinglow-cost, naturally occurring materials, such as bentonite, date pit, andchitosan nanoparticles. The ability of potential adsorbents was also investigatedusing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD),scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), andtransmission electron microscope (TEM). Moreover, their impact on milk'snutritional properties was considered. The results revealed that most milksamples contained Pb and Cd, with mean values of 0.237 +/- 0.179 and 0.041 +/-0.036 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the three possible adsorbentsdemonstrated high sequestering ability due to their existing functional groups;the adsorption capacity of bentonite to Pb and Cd was 84 and 88%, date pit was 97and 93%, and chitosan nanoparticles were 82 and 98%, respectively, with nodiscernible change in milk nutritional contents. In conclusion, the bentonite,date pit, and chitosan nanoparticles were found to be significantly effective andsafe in removing hazardous trace elements (Pb and Cd) from contaminated milk.

AB  - Background: Sperm quality has an important role in the success of assistedreproductive techniques, by adding some bioactive agents with a positive impacton sperms, it can be improved. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate theeffects of kisspeptin on the sperm motility criteria, Lactate dehydrogenase-C(LDHC) activity, acrosomal reaction, and capacitation in the mouse testicularsperm in vitro. Materials and Methods: Sperm samples were extracted from testesof 96 male Balb/C mice weighing 25-30 gr, aged 6-8 wk. Then, they were separated into 4 parts; 2 controls and 2 kisspeptin-treated aliquots; each one incubatedfor either 15 or 30 min. The sperm motility and the LDHC activity were evaluated,and also the frequency of the non-capacitated, intact, and acrosomal-reactedsperms were evaluated by staining with Wheat germ agglutinin, Peanut agglutinin, and Concanavalin A, respectively. The stained sperms were analyzed by flowcytometry and fluorescent microscope. Results: Our result showed that kisspeptin increased both the sperm motility (p = 0.04) and LDHC enzyme activity (p = 0.04) after 15 min of incubation. At the same time, it did not impact the frequency of the non-capacitated, intact and acrosomal-reacted sperms after incubation in the same period (p = 0.16). Conclusion: A 15 min period of incubation with kisspeptincould be applicable for evaluating sperm motility and LDH activity.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM10)-induced respiratory illnesses are difficult toinvestigate in trans-well culture systems. Microphysiological systems offer thecapacity to mimic these phenomena to analyze any possible hazards that PM10exposure poses to respiratory system of Humans. This study proposes an on-chiphealthy human lung distal airway model that efficiently reconstitutes invivo-like environmental conditions in a microfluidic device. The lung-on-chipmodel comprises a TEER sensor chip and portable microscope for continuousmonitoring. To determine the efficacy of our model, we assessed the response toexposure to three PM environmental conditions (mild, average, and severe) andanalyzed the relevant in vivo physiological and toxicological data using theairway model. Our results revealed significant increases in the levels of theIL-13, IL-6, and MUC5AC pathological biomarkers, which indicate increasedincidences of on-chip asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseconditions. Overall, we deduced that this model will facilitate theidentification of potential therapeutics and the prevention of chroniclife-threatening toxicities and pandemics such as COVID-19. The proposed systemprovides basic data for producing an improved in organ-on-chip technology.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s13206-022-00068-x.

AB  - Normal breast luminal epithelial progenitors have been implicated as cell oforigin in basal-like breast cancer, but their anatomical localization remainsunderstudied. Here, we combine collection under the microscope of organoids from reduction mammoplasties and single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) ofFACS-sorted luminal epithelial cells with multicolor imaging to profile ducts andterminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) and compare them with breast cancer subtypes.Unsupervised clustering reveals eleven distinct clusters and a differentiationtrajectory starting with keratin 15(+) (K15(+)) progenitors enriched in ducts.Spatial mapping of luminal progenitors is confirmed at the protein level bystaining with critical duct markers. Comparison of the gene expression profilesof normal luminal cells with those of breast cancer subtypes suggests a strongcorrelation between normal breast ductal progenitors and basal-like breastcancer. We propose that K15(+) basal-like breast cancers originate in ductalprogenitors, which emphasizes the importance of not only lineages but alsocellular position within the ductal-lobular tree.

AB  - The bioluminescent visualization of individual mammalian cells usually requiresthe addition of a luciferin substrate. This chapter describes the microscopicimaging of single cells by their bioluminescence (BL) emission generated without an external luciferin. Imaging is based on the expression of codon-optimized lux (co lux) genes and does not require manipulation of the cells apart fromtransfection. Due to the high brightness of the co lux system, light emissionfrom single cells can be observed continuously for many hours using a specializedmicroscope.

LID - 10.1186/s40360-022-00593-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol compound found in grapes, veratrumand other plants. It has been reported that RSV has anti-inflammatory,anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and other pharmacological effects. However, the impactsof RSV on development of nervous system are not understood well. The study aimsto investigate RSV's neuroprotective effect during development and to provide ahealth care for pregnant women and their fetuses with RSV supplementation.METHODS: In this study, we induced human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to form the embryoid bodies (EBs) and cerebral organoids (COs) with 3 dimensional(3D) culture. In the meantime, D-galactose (D-gal, 5 mg/ml) was used to makenervous injury model, and on the other hand, RSV with various doses, such as 2mum/L, 10 mum/L, 50 mum/L, were applied to understand its neuroprotection.Therefore, the cultures were divided into control group, D-gal nervous injurygroup and RSV intervention groups. After that, the diameters of EBs and COs were measured regularly under a reverted microscope. In the meantime, the neuralproliferation, cell apoptosis and the differentiation of germ layers weredetected via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: (1) D-gal could delay the developmentof EBs and COs; (2) RSV could rescue the atrophy of EBs and COs caused by D-gal; (3) RSV showed its neuroprotection, through promoting the neural cellproliferation, inhibiting apoptosis and accelerating the differentiation of germ layers. CONCLUSION: RSV has a neuroprotective effect on the development of thenervous system, suggesting RSV supplementation may be necessary during the healthcare of pregnancy and childhood.

AB  - A novel Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly (4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) hydrogel system is synthesized with different ratios, in the presence of cross-linker N,N,- methylene bis-acrylamide (MBA). The hydrogel is characterized via FTIRspectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), andscanning electron microscope (SEM). The FTIR results showed a strong interaction between both CMC, P4VP and the loaded fertilizer. The water uptake of thehydrogel was evaluated by swelling tests under variations in pH, biodegradabilitywas investigated in soil to simulate real-world conditions. To determine the bestrelease behavior of urea and calcium nitrate from the hydrogel, fertilizers were loaded with different ratios onto the hydrogel during its formation. Fertilizers release was followed by Atomic absorption spectroscopy to study the release ofcalcium nitrate and urea. Release kinetic parameters were obtained based ondifferent mathematical models as Zero order, First order, Korsmeyer-Peppas andHiguchi models. The suitable proportionality between the mathematical models usedand the fertilizers release was determined based on the correlation coefficients (R(2)). According to Zero order model urea release showed independentconcentration. Based on Korsmeyer-Pappas and Higuchi models with high n value andR(2) equals to 0.97. Compared to urea, Ca(2+), Zero order and Higuchi have beenignored due to their poor correlation coefficients values as proportion withCa(2+) fertilizer release.

AB  - This study emphasizes on the cellulase production characteristics of strain ZY7and its collaboration with nitrate-dependent ferrous oxidizing (NFO) strain XL4to achieve efficient denitrification at low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio.Results indicated that the denitrification efficiency increased from 65.47 to97.99% at 24 h after co-culture at C/N of 1.0. Three-dimensional fluorescenceexcitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) showed significant changes in the intensityof soluble microbial products (SMP), fulvic-like materials, and aromatic proteinsafter co-culture. Bio-precipitates were characterized by Scanning electronmicroscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and X-raydiffraction (XRD), which showed that cellulose structure was disrupted and themetabolites were potential carbon source for denitrification. In addition,cellulase activity suggested that the hydrolysis of beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds andoligosaccharides may be the rate-limiting steps in cellulose degradation. Thiswork promoted the understanding of denitrification characteristics of co-culture and expanded the application of cellulose degrading bacteria in sewage treatment.

LID - 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c00647 [doi]
AB  - Made of a thin non-superconducting metal (N) sandwiched by two superconductors(S), SNS Josephson junctions enable novel quantum functionalities by mixing upthe intrinsic electronic properties of N with the superconducting correlationsinduced from S by proximity. Electronic properties of these devices are governed by Andreev quasiparticles (Andreev, A. Sov. Phys. JETP 1965, 20, 1490) which are absent in conventional SIS junctions whose insulating barrier (I) between the twoS electrodes owns no electronic states. Here we focus on the Josephson vortex(JV) motion inside Nb-Cu-Nb proximity junctions subject to electric currents and magnetic fields. The results of local (magnetic force microscopy) and global(transport) experiments provided simultaneously are compared with our numericalmodel, revealing the existence of several distinct dynamic regimes of the JVmotion. One of them, identified as a fast hysteretic entry/escape below thecritical value of Josephson current, is analyzed and suggested forlow-dissipative logic and memory elements.

AB  - Intracellular membrane trafficking is a dynamic and complex cellular process. To study membrane trafficking with a high spatiotemporal resolution, we present anoptogenetic method based on a blue-light inducible oligomerization of RabGTPases, termed light-activated reversible inhibition by assembly trap ofintracellular membranes (IM-LARIAT). In this chapter, we focus on the opticaldisruption of the dynamics and functions of previously studied intracellularmembrane trafficking events, including transferrin recycling and growth coneregulation in relation to specific Rab GTPases. To aid general application, weprovide a detailed description of transfection, imaging with a confocalmicroscope, and analysis of data.

TI  - Imaging Insulin Granule Dynamics in Human Pancreatic beta-Cells Using TotalInternal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy.
PG  - 79-88
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-2209-4_7 [doi]
AB  - Due to the ultra-thin optical sectioning capability of exclusively illuminatingspace at the interface where total internal reflection occurs, the TIRFmicroscope has been indispensable for monitoring biological processes adjacent tothe plasma membrane with excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Insulin-containinggranules fuse with the plasma membrane to release contents within hundreds ofmilliseconds, which involves well-orchestrated assembly of SNARE complex andassociated proteins. A video-rate multiple-color TIRF microscope offers theunique opportunity to visualize single secretory granule docking and fusiondynamics and can also map its regulators with high spatiotemporal resolution.Here, we describe the basic principles and practical implementation of a fastdual-color TIRF microscope, detailing a how-to guide on imaging and analysis ofinsulin granule dynamics in human beta-cells.

LID - 10.1080/15459624.2022.2100408 [doi]
AB  - This study focuses on reprocessing a group of filtering facepiece respirators(FFR) using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). The aim is to explore the possibility of disinfecting selected KN95 FFRs, in comparison with the N95 FFRs, and assess their viability for reusage. For this purpose, five models of unusedN95 and KN95 FFR models obtained from the hospital were exposed to UV-C lightusing a customized UVGI chamber. The material integrity of treated FFRs wasexamined in terms of particle penetration and strap tension. The surfacemorphology of all models is inspected to determine the visible changes of eachFFR upon exposure to 1-100 cycles (1 cycle is equivalent to 1 J/cm(2) UV dose).The penetration test results indicate that the physical properties of the KN95and N95 FFRs remain within permissible limits despite being reprocessed by up to 100 cycles (100 J/cm(2)). Using a microscope, the physical observations alsoreveal that no visible damage can be seen even after 100 J/cm(2) exposure. Apart from the filter bodies, the tension of each strap were also found to not besignificantly affected by UV radiation by at least 10 disinfection cycles (10J/cm(2)). This confirms that KN95, as well as N95 FFRs, can be subjected to UVtreatment as a means for disinfection.

TI  - First Report of Trichoderma crassum Causing Leaf Spot on Tomato (Solanumlycopersicum cv. M82) in Ohio.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-22-1093-PDN [doi]
AB  - Trichoderma is a genus of wood-decaying fungi generally found in soil (Druzhininaand Kubicek 2005). Trichoderma crassum was confirmed to be a sister species to T.virens according to the molecular sequencing results (Chaverri et al. 2003). Afoliar disease with ~70% incidence on Solanum lycopersicum was observed in agreenhouse at The Ohio State University (40 degrees 0'8'' north latitude, 83degrees 1'36'' west longitude), Columbus, United States, in December 2021. Onaverage up to 60% of the leaves per two-month-old tomato plant were infected.Initially, the dark-grey color and irregular spots appeared at the leaf tips. As the disease progressed, the yellow necrotic lesions were observed surrounding thepreformed disease spots. Finally, the infected leaves appeared curled and wilted as a whole. The leaf fragments from three tomato plants 40 inches apart were cut from the diseased lesions and surface sterilized with 75% ethanol (30 seconds)and 1% NaOCl (60 seconds), subsequently rinsed with sterilized deionized waterthree times. Nine pieces of the sterilized leaf tissues were then placed on thePDA plates at 28 in the dark and incubated in one incubator for 4 days. The pure cultures of five isolates were acquired and examined with a light microscope. Thefungus from all the isolates changed from white to dark green with the radialpattern and profuse sporulation on the PDA. The produced round conidia wereobserved under a light microscope (Fig S1). The DNA was extracted from tworepresentative isolates which showed the same morphology. The internaltranscribed spacer (ITS) region and a conserved fungal rRNA region were amplifiedusing the primers ITS1/ITS4 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3' and5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') (White et al. 1990) and SR6f/SR7r(5'-TGTTACGACTTTTACTT-3' and 5'-AGTTAAAAAGCTCGTAGTTG-3') (Hirose et al. 2012),respectively. The PCR products were further sequenced by Sanger sequencing (TableS1). Based on the BLAST results through NCBI website, the ITS sequences of thetwo isolates were 99% (566/572) and 98% (558/572) identical to Trichodermacrassum DAOM 164916 (EU280067). Their SR sequences both showed 99% (290/293;289/293) identity to the same strain. The phylogenetic tree was also created withthe sequences of ITS region by MEGA software (version 11) (Fig S2). Therefore,the fungus was identified as Trichoderma crassum based on its morphologicalcharacteristics (green conidia), Sanger sequencing results, and phylogenetictree. To complete Koch's postulates, the 5-mm-diameter fungal agar discs of7-day-old pure cultures were used for the inoculation on 18 healthy leaves of sixtomato cv. M82 plants with two-month-old. The sterile pure PDA discs of the equalsize were used for the mock inoculation as a comparison. Fungal plug method waschosen in this study because it had been widely applied to characterization ofthe fungal pathogens causing leaf spot disease (Pornsuriya et al. 2020; Yang etal. 2021). Five days later, the same symptom as those that occurred on thepreviously naturally infected tomato plants were observed on all the inoculatedleaves (Fig S3A). However, there were no symptoms on the leaves with the mockinoculation. The fungus re-isolated from the symptomatic leaves showed theconsistent morphology (dark-green color with radial sporulation) with theoriginal isolates (Fig S3B). Thus, Trichoderma crassum was verified as the causalagent of the foliar disease on Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82 in our greenhouse. Toour knowledge, it is the first report of Trichoderma crassum leading to the leaf spot and wilt on tomato in Ohio. The identification of the causal agent lays the groundwork for the development of necessary disease management techniques.

TI  - Focus variation due to near infrared laser in a confocal microscope.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24198 [doi]
AB  - Focus precision and stability is crucial in confocal microscopy not only forimage sharpness but also to avoid radiometric fluctuations that can wrongly beinterpreted as variations of the fluorescence intensity in the sample. Here wereport a focus variation provoked by a continuous wave laser of 810-nm wavelengthintroduced along the optical path of an inverted confocal microscope with an oil immersion x60 objective. When the laser is turned on or off, the focus positiondrifts toward lower or high values of the vertical coordinate z, respectively.The maximum drift observed was 2.25 m for a laser power of 40 mW at the sampleand over a 600-s exposure time. The temporal evolution of the focus position iswell fitted by exponential curves that mimic temperature variations due to a heatsource. Our analysis strongly suggests that the focus drift is due to heating of the immersion oil.

PG  - e110550
LID - 10.15252/embj.2021110550 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor for cardiovasculardisease, which is the leading cause of death worldwide. The somatic isoform ofangiotensin I-converting enzyme (sACE) plays a critical role in blood pressureregulation, and ACE inhibitors are thus widely used to treat hypertension andcardiovascular disease. Our current understanding of sACE structure, dynamics,function, and inhibition has been limited because truncated, minimallyglycosylated forms of sACE are typically used for X-ray crystallography andmolecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the first cryo-EM structures offull-length, glycosylated, soluble sACE (sACE(S1211) ). Both monomeric anddimeric forms of the highly flexible apo enzyme were reconstructed from a single dataset. The N- and C-terminal domains of monomeric sACE(S1211) were resolved at 3.7 and 4.1 A, respectively, while the interacting N-terminal domains responsiblefor dimer formation were resolved at 3.8 A. Mechanisms are proposed forintradomain hinging, cooperativity, and homodimerization. Furthermore, theobservation that both domains were in the open conformation has implications for the design of sACE modulators.

TI  - A Method to Visualize and Quantify the Intraosseous Arteries of the Femoral Head by Vascular Corrosion Casting.
LID - 10.1111/os.13319 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a method to display the three-dimensional distribution of intraosseous arteries in the femoral head by vascular corrosion casting. METHODS:An experimental study was done to expose the intraosseous arteries of the femoralhead by a microperfusion corrosion method between January 2021 and May 2021.Specimens were 23 swine femoral heads (12 female specimens and 11 male specimens,where age of swine ranged from 8 to 12 months, and the weight was approximately150 kg). The femoral heads were microperfused with the vascular casting resinthrough retinacular arteries, and the bone of the femoral head was dissolved with50% sodium hydroxide and 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed under the microscopeuntil the vessel casts were completely exposed. The distribution and anastomosis of the arteries in the femoral head were observed under direct vision andmicroscopy. The diameter of the artery in the femoral head was measured at 0.5 cmafter its entry into the bone of the femoral head with a microscale under themicroscope. The number of internal arteries with diameter >/=0.05 mm was counted.The number and diameter of the main trunk of the epiphyseal arteries in thefemoral head between male and female swine were compared. RESULTS: The vascularcasting specimen of the swine femoral head was successfully produced by usingepoxy resin as a casting agent, and the three-dimensional intraosseous vascularstructures were clearly visible. The number of epiphyseal arteries in male andfemale swine was 8.55 +/- 2.15 and 8.83 +/- 2.15 (t = -0.31, p = 0.38),respectively. The diameters of the superior epiphyseal arteries in male andfemale swine were 0.35 +/- 0.09 and 0.31 +/- 0.08 mm (t = 1.03, p = 0.16), thediameters of the inferior epiphyseal arteries were 0.47 +/- 0.05 and 0.49 +/-0.09 mm (t = -0.57, p = 0.29), and the diameters of the anterior epiphysealarteries were 0.34 +/- 0.08 and 0.33 +/- 0.13 mm (t = 0.32, p = 0.37). There was no significant difference in the number and diameter of the main trunk ofintraosseous arteries between male and female swine (p > 0.05). The main trunk ofintraosseous arteries formed an anastomosis in the center of the femoral head.Among 23 swine femoral head samples, three types of intraosseous anastomosis wereobserved, including 13 (57%) posterior superior-posterior inferior, seven (30%)posterior inferior-anterior, and three (13%) uniform intraosseous anastomosis.CONCLUSION: The microperfusion corrosion method can produce the vascular casting specimen of swine femoral head revealing the three-dimensional structure of theintraosseous artery, which clearly shows the origin, course and branches, anddiameter, as well as the anastomosis, of nutrient arteries in the femoral head.This method provides a simple and rapid technique for quantifying and visualizingintraosseous arteries.

AB  - Toxicity evaluations involve the analysis of multiple biomarkers. In this study, the liver, target organ analyzed by treatments with iron concentrations,indicated the accumulation of lipids as a response. Considering that thedistribution of lipids in an organ is directly related to the induction ofinflammatory processes by aquatic contaminants, this study proposes to carry out an integrative investigation of the behavior and the distribution of lipids inthe liver tissue. Techniques of light and electron microscopy were performed inorder to propose a new way of assessing and quantifying the distribution of lipiddroplets, also presenting methodological alternatives that can be chosen by thereader according to the interests and resources available. Thus, it is assumedthat the method begins with the fixation of the liver with Glutaraldehyde 2,5% inPBS 0,1 M and continues with post fixation with osmium tretoxide 1%, which marks lipids. For this proposition, two inclusion methodologies were performed tohistological analyses in Historesin and ultrastructural analyses in EMBeed 812.For light microscopy (LM) analyses, cuts were obtained with 2,5 micrometersthickness, which were stained with (1) Mayers hematoxylin and (2) toluidine blue.The images obtained were processed in software Image J Fiji to evidence the lipiddistribution in liver.*Cytological reactions with osmium tetroxide constitute lowcomplexity methods that allow the optimization of the localization,identification and quantification of lipid droplets in the liver tissue whenanalyzed under the conventional light microscope.*Samples included in EMBeed 812 resin commonly used in Transmission Electron Microscopy can be analyzed bySEM-BEC, as complementary analyses for the detection of lipids.*Using SEM-BEC andconventional light microscopy, it is possible to quantify the area occupied bylipid droplets using Image J Fiji software, as these are contrasted due to thereaction with osmium tetroxide.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S359642 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to construct a DOX conjugate with liver tumor targetingand acid sensitivity based on a short aromatic peptide FFYEE, which could amplifythe tumor inhibition efficacy of DOX and alleviate tissue toxicity. Methods: Anovel DOX-peptide conjugate, D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX, was constructed by linking DOX to the side chain of FFYEE with acid-sensitive hydrazone bond and by modifyingthe C-terminal of peptide with alpha-D-galactosamine (D-gal) as targeting ligand.The structure of D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX was characterized by mass spectrometry,infrared spectroscopy (IR), and UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The assemblycharacteristics of pentapeptide FFYEE and D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX were observed bytransmission electron microscope (TEM). In vitro drug release, cytotoxicity,endocytosis, in vivo antitumor experiment and histopathology analysis wereinvestigated. Results: Peptide FFYEE endowed the D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX withself-assembly performance and improved biocompatibility. D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX can self-assemble into nanofibers with a diameter of ~ 40 nm in neutral aqueoussolution and significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of free DOX to L02 cells. In vitro drug release results showed that D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX had acid sensitivityand controlled release characteristics. The cytotoxicity and endocytosisinvestigations confirmed that D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX enhanced the cellular uptake ofDOX and inhibition effect on HepG2 cells. In vivo antitumor experiment indicated that D-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX could significantly inhibit the growth of liver tumor inmice and reduce the side effects of DOX. Conclusion: The conjugateD-gal-FFYEE-hyd-DOX with liver tumor targeting and acid sensitivity has thecharacteristics of strong tumor inhibition and low toxicity, hinting the greatclinical application potential for targeted delivery of DOX in cancer treatment.

TI  - Fasudil on Myocardial Injury in Rats with Myocardial Ischemia and Reperfusionthrough Rho-ROCK Signal Pathway.
PG  - 64-72
LID - 10.14715/cmb/2021.67.5.9 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are very harmful to human life and health. Reperfusiontherapy is a standard method to treat cardiovascular diseases and has achievedhigh clinical effects. However, this treatment method is likely to causemyocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has been reported that the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil can interfere with cardiomyocyte apoptosis through the Rho-ROCKsignaling pathway, so it is often used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Theessay aims to research this specific influence of fasudil on cardiac damage inmyocardial ischemia-reperfusion mouses through the Rho-ROCK signal path and itsrelated mechanisms. Forty rats were taken as the research object, and the mouses were separated into control clusters. In the observation cluster of fasudil, the rat heart device was perfused by surgery. The rat coronary artery was ligated for20 minutes to make the rat myocardial ischemia. Then, the ligation was loosenedfor myocardial perfusion to create a rat myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model.Observation group rats were perfused with quantitative fasudil, 80 minutes after ischemia-reperfusion, the ultrastructural changes and myocardial ischemic area ofthe rat myocardium were observed under a microscope, and the dynamic changes ofthe mouse heart were examined by flow cytometry. The PCR fluorescence method was used to explore the outlook layer of Rho-ROCK kinase activity to detect ratcardiomyocyte apoptosis. It is shown that under this intervention of fasudil,this expression level of Rho-ROCK kinase activity in the observation group wasreduced by 18.3%, the myocardial cell apoptosis rate was decreased by 26.4%, and one area of myocardial ischemia can be reduced by 32.5%. The ultrastructure ofthe new object in rats is improved, and the left ventricular diastolic andsystolic effect is enhanced. Therefore, the fasudil may decrease cardiac ischemiaand focus on injured Rho-ROCK signal path activity.

PG  - 96-103
LID - 10.14715/cmb/2021.67.5.13 [doi]
AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion damage to the myocardium is inevitable. This study mainlyexplored the effect of remifentanil anesthesia on the expression ofapoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 and Bax in rat myocardial ischemia-reperfusioninjury. Select 48 mice (n=6). First, prepare solutions of differentconcentrations of remifentanil. A model of ischemia-reperfusion cardiomyocyteswas established, and 6 slices of tissue were taken from each specimen, and thepositive cells were observed with an optical microscope and magnified 100 times. Bcl-2 and Bax were positive in the cytoplasm and yellowish-brown particles in theinner membrane. According to the distribution of positive cells, randomly select 3 clear fields of view from each part, count the number of positive cells in eachfield, and then take the average of the proportion of positive cells to get Bcl-2or Bax protein-positive Index (PEI). Comparison of mRNA levels in each group:Compared with the R3 group, the ratio of the M, R1, and R2 groups increased, and the mRNA expression level of the M group increased almost 3 times, P<0.05. Theresults of the study show that remifentanil reduces the mortality of myocardialcells by regulating the appearance of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, and has a certainprotective effect on the rat heart during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.There is no statistically significant difference in the protective effect ofremifentanil on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.

AB  - This study focused on miR-494 inhibiting the proliferation, migration andinvasion of cervical cancer cells by regulating HCCR1. During the study, 30 pairsof primary cervical cancer tissues and adjacent tissues diagnosed by pathologywere collected, and then placed in a cryopreservation tube, immediately placed inliquid nitrogen to freeze, and then moved to a -80 degrees C refrigerator forstorage until use. They were dipped with crystal violet staining solution for 20 minutes, washed 3 times with PBS, and dried at room temperature. Thepolycarbonate film on the chamber was gently cut, placed on a glass slide, andcovered with neutral resin. The number of cells in 5 random fields was countedunder a microscope, and the differences between the groups were compared. TheqRT-PCR results showed that compared with the normal cervical tissue cell lineHCCR1, the expression levels of miR-494 in cervical cancer cell lines HCCR1 andC-33A were significantly reduced. Compared with the transfection of mimics NC,the level of HCCR1mRNA and protein decreased significantly when transfected with miRNA-494mimics (P <0.05); compared with the transfection of inhibitor NC, thelevel of HCCR1 mRNA and protein increased significantly when transfected withmiRNA-494 inhibitor (P <0.05).

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases have become a mainstream disease by intensifying thecountry's population aging. The purpose of this article is to explore thespecific effect and mechanism of lipid metabolism imbalance through the NF-KBpathway on atherosclerosis and vascular aging in rats. Twenty healthy adult rats were randomly divided into two groups, control in the observation group and theobservation group. The rats in the observation group were fed a high-fat diet to imbalance the lipid metabolism of the rats. Immunohistochemistry and transmissionelectron microscope detectors were used to observe the NF-KB pathway in rats and study atherosclerosis-specific conditions of sclerosis and vascular aging. Theresults show that the imbalance of lipid metabolism through the NF-KB pathway canincrease the rate of apoptosis in rat blood vessels by 24% and the proliferation rate by 18%. The number of vascular endothelial cell damage increased by 33%,which promoted atherosclerosis in rats and increased the rate of vascular agingin rats by 27%.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects on airway obstruction and endothelialfunction by extracting and analyzing plasma exosomes with OSA patients. For this purpose, the clinical data and imaging data of 60 patients with OSA wereretrospectively analyzed, who were admitted to the Central Hospital from Apr2018 to Jul2021By using an electron microscope for the observation of exosomes, thedegree of airway obstruction was compared by pulmonary function instrument, andHE staining was performed to analyze them. The results showed that the diameterof exosome particles was concentrated at 80.5 ~ 158.6 nm, the diameter of OSAexosomes was concentrated at about 121.9 nm, and the diameter of exosomes in the control group was concentrated at about 145.0 nm. Compared with the patients inthe control group, the level of miRNA-33b-3p in the control group wassignificantly different (P < 0.05). The content of exosomal miRNA-33b-3p in OSApatients decreased significantly, and the corresponding airway obstructionincreased. The results of HE staining showed that there were obviousatherosclerotic plaques in the arterial endothelium of the OSA group, and theatherosclerotic plaques were significantly reduced after miRNA-33b-3p injection(P < 0.05). In general, OSA patients can regulate airway obstruction andendothelial cell function by controlling the expression of Plasma exosomes andmiRNA-33b-3p, resulting in increased airway obstruction and endothelial cellatherosclerosis.

AB  - ALCL is an aggressive lymphoma. In most cases, it is diagnosed as stage II or IV in the initial diagnosis, but it has a good response to concurrent chemotherapywith epinephrine. The six-year survival rate is about 50%. This study focused on miR-181b inhibiting the proliferation of the lymphoma Rajixi cell line byregulating the expression of the target gene FAMLF. Observe the morphology of HE with an optical microscope. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on aseries of lymphocyte surface markers and cytotoxic granular membranes. In 28ALCL cases, PCR detection of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene recombination wasperformed. Summarize the characteristics of ALCL clinical pathology and the main points of diagnosis and differential diagnosis in daily business, summarize thecharacteristics of ALK-positive and the cytotoxicity of ALCL, and conduct apreliminary investigation on the cell source, pathological organization and tumorclassification. Only four ENBAI subtypes, v-Val, P-THR, V-leu, and P-ALA weredetected in lymphoma tissue, and no V-Pro subtype was found. Of the 110 positive lymphomas, 107 were single-digit Rajixi 18 (33%), and the remaining 1 (14%) were double-infected Rajixi. The results show that miR-181b can inhibit theproliferation of the lymphoma Rajixi cell line by regulating the expression ofthe target gene FAMLF.

LID - 10.14715/cmb/2021.67.6.33 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare and analyze the effect of N-cadherin on chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and toexplore the related mechanism, so as to provide a novel theoretical basis for theclinical work of articular cartilage injury regeneration and repair. For thispurpose, the experimental animals were clean grade SD rats (aged 5-6 weeks,weighing 180-250g). Alcian blue staining was carried out to observe the inducedchondrogenesis following N-cadherin inhibition. The specific role of N-cadherinin the Wnt signaling pathway and chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs wasdetected by Western blot; while the effect of N-cadherin on the molecular levelchanges of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm was evaluated by fluorescencequantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, immunoprecipitation (IP) wasused for the verification of the interaction between N-cadherin and beta-catenin.Results showed that under the light microscope, 90% of the BMSCs at the thirdgeneration, 90% of the cells were fused. Alcian blue staining showed that thegreen staining area in the BMP2 induction group was large and dense, while thatin the N-cadherin inhibition group and blank control group was small and sparse. Western blot revealed that N-cadherin and SOX9 were significantly developed inthe BMP2 induction group, but Wnt3a was not significantly developed. While in theN-cadherin inhibition group, the development of Wnt3a was obvious, yet withoutevident development of N-cadherin and SOX9. The qRT-PCR indicated that therelative mRNA expression of Wnt3a was significantly increased in the N-cadherininhibition group (P<0.05). However, no obvious difference was observed in themRNA expression of beta-catenin between the BMP2 induction group and theN-cadherin inhibition group (P>0.05). Western blot indicated that in the BMP2induction group; there existed the development of beta-catenin, significantdevelopment of phos-GSK-3beta and total GSK-3beta, but no obvious development of Wnt3a. In the N-cadherin inhibition group, there was significantly enhanceddevelopment of Wnt3a and beta-catenin than that before, blurred development ofphos-GSK-3beta than that before, and also obvious development of total GSK-3beta with little change from before. N-cadherin promoted the expression ofbeta-catenin mostly in the cell membrane, but only a few in the cytoplasm andnucleus. Additionally, verification by IP showed that N-cadherin and beta-cateninwere developed on N-cadherin and beta-catenin bands, suggesting an interactionbetween N-cadherin and beta-catenin. According to these results, N-cadherin canultimately promote chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs by inhibiting the Wntsignaling pathway.

TI  - Faster cytotoxicity with age: Increased perforin and granzyme levels in cytotoxicCD8(+) T cells boost cancer cell elimination.
PG  - e13668
LID - 10.1111/acel.13668 [doi]
AB  - A variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to the altered efficiencyof CTLs in elderly organisms. In particular, the efficacy of antiviral CD8(+) Tcells responses in the elderly has come back into focus since the COVID-19pandemic outbreak. However, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to alterationsin T cell function and the origin of the observed impairments have not been fullyexplored. Therefore, we investigated whether intrinsic changes affect thecytotoxic ability of CD8(+) T cells in aging. We focused on the differentsubpopulations and time-resolved quantification of cytotoxicity during tumor cellelimination. We report a surprising result: Killing kinetics of CD8(+) T cellsfrom elderly mice are much faster than those of CD8(+) T cells from adult mice.This is true not only in the total CD8(+) T cell population but also for theireffector (TEM ) and central memory (TCM ) T cell subpopulations. TIRF experimentsreveal that CD8(+) T cells from elderly mice possess comparable numbers of fusionevents per cell, but significantly increased numbers of cells with granulefusion. Analysis of the cytotoxic granule (CG) content shows significantlyincreased perforin and granzyme levels and turns CD8(+) T cells of elderly miceinto very efficient killers. This highlights the importance of distinguishingbetween cell-intrinsic alterations and microenvironmental changes in elderlyindividuals. Our results also stress the importance of analyzing the dynamics of CTL cytotoxicity against cancer cells because, with a simple endpoint lysisanalysis, cytotoxic differences could have easily been overlooked.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The impact of different surface treatments and shades onthe color, translucency, and surface roughness of high-translucency self-glazedzirconia materials is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was toinvestigate the effects of different external surface treatments (self-glazed,milled, polished, and glazed), intaglio surface treatments (milled andairborne-particle abraded), and shades (A1 and A3 shades) on the color,translucency, and surface roughness of high-translucency self-glazed zirconiamaterials, as well as the correlations among optical parameters, translucency,and surface roughness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty shade A1 and 80 shade A3disks were fabricated with a thickness of 0.80 +/-0.02 mm and divided into 16groups (n=10). Different external and intaglio surface treatments were applied tothe specimens. CIELab values were measured with a spectrophotometer, and colordifferences (DeltaE00) and relative translucency parameter (RTP) were calculated.Total transmittance (Tt%) and reflectance (R%) were tested with aspectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Surface roughness (Ra and Rz) (mum) was measured with a noncontact 3-dimensional laser scanning microscope.One specimen from each group was subjected to scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and the Tukey post hoc test. Thecorrelation among optical parameters, translucency, and surface roughness wasinvestigated by using Pearson correlation analysis (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Theeffects of external surface treatments, intaglio airborne-particle abrasion, and shades on DeltaE00, RTP, and Ra values of the disks were significantly different (P<.001). The smoothest external polishing surface had the greatest RTP and colordifference (P<.001). Shade A3 disks had lower RTP and Tt% values than shade A1disks (P<.001). DeltaE00 had a highly positive relationship with the RTP (A1:r=0.884, P<.001; A3: r=0.859, P<.001). SEM images demonstrated that surfacetreatments affected the surface texture of monolithic zirconia ceramics.CONCLUSIONS: Different surface treatments affected the surface roughness,translucency, and final color of zirconia materials. The smoothest externalpolishing surface had the greatest RTP and color difference. Different shadesinfluenced the translucency, as the darker the disk shade, the lower thetranslucency. The RTP was appropriate as an auxiliary indicator for evaluatingthe color of a dental ceramic.

AB  - Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their two-dimensional limit are diverse,flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena andtheir future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronouncedCoulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin-physics, and theease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticatedheterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of manytwo-dimensional semiconductors and semi-metals are relevant for theirtechnological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. Inthis paper, we review the recent advances made in studying out-of-equilibrium,light-induced, phenomena in these materials using powerful, surface-sensitive,time-resolved photoemission-based techniques, with a particular emphasis on theemerging multi-dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time-resolved momentum microscopy. We discuss the advances this technique has enabled instudying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials.Then, we project for the future research directions opened by these scientificand instrumental advancements, studying the physics of two-dimensional materials and the opportunities to engineer their band-structure and band-topology by laserfields.

TI  - Office-Based Lymphatic Supermicrosurgery: Supermicrosurgical LymphaticovenularAnastomosis at an Outpatient Clinic.
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1750123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) has becomepopular for the treatment of compression-refractory lymphedema. With advancement of navigation tools, LVA can be performed with more ease and safety, allowingoffice-based LVA at an outpatient clinic. METHODS: Office-based LVA was performedon patients with compression-refractory secondary extremity lymphedema by awell-experienced supermicrosurgeon (T.Y.) under local infiltration anesthesia.Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography and vein visualizer were used to localizevessels preoperatively. A stereoscopic microscope (Leica S6E, Leica Microsystems,Germany) or a relatively small operative microscope (OPMI pico, Carl Zeiss,Germany) was used for LVA. Operative records and postoperative results werereviewed to evaluate feasibility of office-based LVA. RESULTS: LVAs wereperformed on 27 arms and 42 legs, which resulted in 131 anastomoses via 117incisions. ICG lymphography stage included stage II in 47 limbs, and stage III in22 limbs. Time required for one LVA procedure (from skin incision to skin closurein one surgical field) ranged from 13 to 37 minutes (average, 24.9 minutes). One year after LVA, all cases showed significant volume reduction (lymphedematousvolume reduction; 0.5-23.6%, average 13.23%). No postoperative complication wasobserved. CONCLUSION: LVA can be performed with safety and effectiveness outside an operation theater. Patient selection, precise preoperative mapping, andexperience of a surgeon are key to successful office-based LVA.

AB  - Using ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectancespectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscope(FE-SEM), we comparatively investigated the unique spectral characteristics ofdifferent natural-color Edison pearls. Edison pearls were firstly divided intotwo types based on theirs corresponding reflection spectral characteristics: typeA with basically uniform reflection feature for each sample; and type B withnon-uniform reflection feature for each one. Raman spectroscopy revealed thatcomplex organic pigments with bands at about 1015, 1124-1134, 1297, 1507-1526,2245, 2620, and 3019 cm(-1), gave rise to the colors of Edison pearls.Interestingly, two bands in the Raman spectra of dark-colored pearls, at about1124-1134 cm(-1) and 1507-1526 cm(-1), corresponded to the stretching modes ofthe C-C single bond (nu2) and the CC double bond (nu1), respectively, shiftedsignificantly toward low wavenumbers. Meanwhile, the intensity ratio between the two bands (I1124-1134/I1085) increased as pearl color became more saturated. Inaddition, six bands at about 2139, 2417, 2521, 2976, 3332, and 3702 cm(-1) werepresent in the Raman spectra of all dark-colored samples, while these bands were absent in the Raman spectra of light-colored ones. This indicated that the exact organic pigments in Edison pearls were not completely consistent, which led tovariation in the coloration and the dominant absorption band in the reflectionspectra of pearl. More importantly, based on our SEM results, as well as ourUV-Vis reflectance spectroscopic analysis, we first proposed that the positionsand relative intensities of the reflection peaks located between 320 nm and 600nm were likely to be associated with the density and the degree of regularity of grooves appeared on the surface of pearl. These findings substantially enhanceour knowledge of gemological characteristics of colored Edison pearl and theformation mechanism of unique reflection features of them. Furthermore, thisstudy revealed key characteristics that can be used to identify imitation andcolor-treated Edison pearls.

AB  - The apical complex of apicomplexan parasites is essential for host cell invasion and intracellular survival and as the site of regulated exocytosis fromspecialised secretory organelles called rhoptries and micronemes. Despite itsimportance, there are few data on the three-dimensional organisation andquantification of these organelles within the apical complex or how they aretrafficked to this specialised region of plasma membrane for exocytosis. Incoccidian apicomplexans there is an additional tubulin-containing hollow barrelstructure, the conoid, which provides a structural gateway for this specialisedapical secretion. Using a combination of cellular electron tomography and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) we have reconstructed theentire apical end of Eimeria tenella sporozoites; we report a detailed dissectionof the three- dimensional organisation of the conoid and show there is highcurvature of the tubulin-containing fibres that might be linked to the unusualcomma-shaped arrangement of protofilaments. We quantified the number and locationof rhoptries and micronemes within cells and show a highly organised gateway for trafficking and docking of rhoptries, micronemes and microtubule-associatedvesicles within the conoid around a set of intra-conoidal microtubules. Finally, we provide ultrastructural evidence for fusion of rhoptries directly through the parasite plasma membrane early in infection and the presence of a pore in theparasitophorous vacuole membrane, providing a structural explanation for howrhoptry proteins may be trafficked between the parasite and the host cytoplasm.

TI  - A Simple Benchtop Filtration Method to Isolate Small Extracellular Vesicles from Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
LID - 10.3791/64106 [doi]
AB  - The ultracentrifugation-based process is considered the common method for smallextracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolation. However, the yield from this isolationmethod is relatively lower, and these methods are inefficient in separating sEVsubtypes. This study demonstrates a simple benchtop filtration method to isolate human umbilical cord-derived MSC small extracellular vesicles (hUC-MSC-sEVs),successfully separated by ultrafiltration from the conditioned medium ofhUC-MSCs. The size distribution, protein concentration, exosomal markers (CD9,CD81, TSG101), and morphology of the isolated hUC-MSC-sEVs were characterizedwith nanoparticle tracking analysis, BCA protein assay, western blot, andtransmission electron microscope, respectively. The isolated hUC-MSC-sEVs' sizewas 30-200 nm, with a particle concentration of 7.75 x 10(10) particles/mL and a protein concentration of 80 microg/mL. Positive bands for exosomal markers CD9,CD81, and TSG101 were observed. This study showed that hUC-MSC-sEVs weresuccessfully isolated from hUC-MSCs conditioned medium, and characterizationshowed that the isolated product fulfilled the criteria mentioned by MinimalInformation for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles 2018 (MISEV 2018).

LID - 10.3791/61293 [doi]
AB  - There is a need to understand materials exposed to overlapping extremeenvironments such as high temperature, radiation, or mechanical stress. Whenthese stressors are combined there may be synergistic effects that enable unique microstructural evolution mechanisms to activate. Understanding of thesemechanisms is necessary for the input and refinement of predictive models andcritical for engineering of next generation materials. The basic physics andunderlying mechanisms require advanced tools to be investigated. The in situ ion irradiation transmission electron microscope (I(3)TEM) is designed to explorethese principles. To quantitatively probe the complex dynamic interactions inmaterials, careful preparation of samples and consideration of experimentaldesign is required. Particular handling or preparation of samples can easilyintroduce damage or features that obfuscate the measurements. There is no onecorrect way to prepare a sample; however, many mistakes can be made. The mostcommon errors and things to consider are highlighted within. The I(3)TEM has manyadjustable variables and a large potential experimental space, therefore it isbest to design experiments with a specific scientific question or questions inmind. Experiments have been performed on large number of sample geometries,material classes, and with many irradiation conditions. The following are asubset of examples that demonstrate unique in situ capabilities utilizing theI(3)TEM. Au nanoparticles prepared by drop casting have been used to investigate the effects of single ion strikes. Au thin films have been used in studies on theeffects of multibeam irradiation on microstructure evolution. Zr films have been exposed to irradiation and mechanical tension to examine creep. Ag nanopillarswere subjected to simultaneous high temperature, mechanical compression, and ion irradiation to study irradiation induced creep as well. These results impactfields including: structural materials, nuclear energy, energy storage,catalysis, and microelectronics in space environments.

TI  - Optical Trapping of Plasmonic Nanoparticles for In Situ Surface-Enhanced RamanSpectroscopy Characterizations.
LID - 10.3791/63862 [doi]
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables the ultrasensitive detectionof analyte molecules in various applications due to the enhanced electric fieldof metallic nanostructures. Salt-induced silver nanoparticle aggregation is themost popular method for generating SERS-active substrates; however, it is limitedby poor reproducibility, stability, and biocompatibility. The present protocolintegrates optical manipulation and SERS detection to develop an efficientanalytical platform to address this. A 1064 nm trapping laser and a 532 nm Raman probe laser are combined in a microscope to assemble silver nanoparticles, which generate plasmonic hotspots for in situ SERS measurements in aqueousenvironments. Without aggregating agents, this dynamic plasmonic silvernanoparticle assembly enables an approximately 50-fold enhancement of the analytemolecule signal. Moreover, it provides spatial and temporal control to form theSERS-active assembly in as low as 0.05 nM analyte-coated silver nanoparticlesolution, which minimizes the potential perturbation for in vivo analysis. Hence,this optical trapping-integrated SERS platform holds great potential forefficient, reproducible, and stable molecular analyses in liquids, especially in aqueous physiological environments.

LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09853 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are environmental pollutants of growing concern, andawareness of MPs pollution in marine and freshwater environments has increased inrecent years. However, knowledge of MPs contamination in riverine sediments inIreland is limited. To address this, we collected and analysed sediment samplesfrom 16 selected sites along the River Barrow. Microplastics were extractedthrough a density separation method, after which their size, colour, and shapewere analysed under a stereo microscope (Optica SZM-2). Attenuated totalreflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used toidentify polymer types. A total of 690 MPs were recovered from the 16 sites, withfibres as the dominant MP type. The highest concentration of MPs was 155 MPfibres kg(-1) wet sediment found in samples collected from Graiguenamanagh, Co.Kilkenny (GK). The majority of the recovered MPs were polyethylene (PE),polypropylene (PP), nylon, and cellulose acetate (CA) fibres. Overall, this studyhighlighted the presence of MPs in Irish river sediments and provided a baseline for future studies on MPs pollution. Further research is needed to betterunderstand sources, distribution, and effects of MPs in freshwater ecosystems.

PG  - 8464082
LID - 10.1155/2022/8464082 [doi]
AB  - Background: Given the cardioprotective role of autophagy, this study aimed toinvestigate the protective effect of exogenous H2S (NaHS) on infectiouscardiomyopathy through the inhibition of the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Methods: In this study, sepsis models were established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)induction in vivo and intraperitoneal injection of NaHS was performed. Autophagy-and apoptosis-related proteins were observed by western blot, isolated myocardialtissue morphology was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, andmyocardial apoptosis was evaluated by the tunnel method. The ultrastructure ofautophagy was observed by using an electron transmission electron microscope.Results: In an SD rat model of cecum ligation puncture-induced sepsis, the level of autophagy-related proteins was significantly increased, and hematoxylin andeosin staining showed irregular myocardial bands and swollen cardiomyocytes.Following NaHS treatment, the level of autophagy-related proteins decreased, and electron transmission microscopy revealed decreased autophagosomes.Echocardiography suggested an increase in ejection fraction and significantrelief of myocardial inhibition. Conclusions: Our results suggest that NaHStreatment can attenuate the cellular damage caused by excessive autophagy throughthe AMPK/mTOR pathway.

PG  - 905-913
LID - 10.18240/ijo.2022.06.07 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of curcumin (Cur) nanoparticles loaded withchitosan derivatives grafted by deoxycholic acid (Chit-DC) on human retinalpigment epithelial (hRPE) cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) mRNA expression. METHODS: Cur nanoparticles were synthesized withChit-DC as the carrier and Cur as the supported drug. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8)method was used to detect the effects of different concentrations of Cur/Chit-DC,Chit-DC, and Cur on the proliferation of hRPE cells for different times. Thechanges of Cur/Chit-DC and Cur on hRPE cell cycle were determined by flowcytometry. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of VEGF in hRPE cellstreated with Cur, Chit-DC and Cur/Chit-DC at 10 microg/mL for 24h. RESULTS:Different concentrations of Chit-DC nanoparticle treated hRPE cells had nosignificant difference in terms of optical density (OD) values compared with the control group at 24h and 48h. Moreover, there was no change in the cellmorphology under a light microscope. After 24h treatment with Cur/Chit-DC andCur, the percentage of G0-G1 phase cells increased and the percentage of S phase cells decreased in all concentration groups. Cur/Chit-DC and Cur in allconcentration groups inhibited the proliferation of hRPE cells in a time and dosedependent manner, and reduced the expression level of VEGF mRNA. CONCLUSION: The Cur/Chit-DC nanoparticles can release Cur continuously and have sustained releasefunction. Both Cur/Chit-DC nanoparticles and Cur could inhibit hRPE cellscultured in vitro, and could reduce the expression level of VEGF mRNA in hRPEcells.

PG  - 375-384
LID - 10.1016/j.sdentj.2022.04.009 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nowadays, attention is directed to herbal treatments in an attempt tolessen the adverse effects of diabetes. Nanoformulation of curcumin (NC) wasshown to enhance stability and water solubility compared to native curcumin.Objective: To examine the effect of different NC concentrations on thehistopathological structure of the submandibular salivary gland of diabetic rats.Methods: 28 rats were divided equally into 4 groups. Group I: Control group,Group II (diabetic), III (diabetic + nanocurcumin low dose), and IV (diabetic +nanocurcumin high dose): Rats of groups II, III and IV were injected with asingle dose of alloxan (140 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. After 7 days, groups IIIand IV were treated for 6 weeks with NC (100 mg/kg/day) for group III, and (200mg/kg/day) for group IV. Submandibular salivary glands were assessedhistologically, immunohistochemically using alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA)and ultrastructurally. Results: Diabetic samples showed destruction ofparenchymal elements of the gland, with thick fiber bundles encircling theexcretory ducts and minimal reaction for alpha SMA. Amelioration of the gland'sarchitecture was detected in groups III and IV with reduction of collagendeposition and elevation of positive immunoreactivity to alpha SMA. Conclusion:NC profoundly repaired the induced diabetic histopathological and ultrastructuralalterations of the gland in a dose dependent manner.

AB  - Infectious disease malaria is a devastating infectious disease that claims thelives of more than 500,000 people worldwide every year. Most of these deathsoccur as a result of a delayed or incorrect diagnosis. At the moment, the manual microscope is considered to be the most effective equipment for diagnosingmalaria. It is, on the other hand, time-consuming and prone to human error.Because it is such a serious global health issue, it is important that theevaluation process be automated. The objective of this article is to advocate forthe automation of the diagnosis process in order to eliminate the need for human intervention in the process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and otherdeep-learning technologies, such as image processing, are being utilized toevaluate parasitemia in microscopic blood slides in order to enhance diagnosticaccuracy. The approach is based on the intensity characteristics of Plasmodiumparasites and erythrocytes, which are both known to be variable. Images ofinfected and noninfected erythrocytes are gathered and fed into the CNN modelsResNet50, ResNet34, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which are all trained on the samedataset. The techniques of transfer learning and fine-tuning are employed, andthe outcomes are contrasted. The VGG-19 model obtained the best overallperformance given the parameters and dataset that were evaluated.

AB  - Developing targeted and slow-release antibiotic delivery systems can effectively reduce drug overdose and side effects. This study aimed to investigate theantimicrobial activity of vancomycin-loaded soy protein nanoparticles(vancomycin-SPNs). For the preparation of SPNs, the desolvation method wasapplied in different concentrations of vancomycin and soy protein (15:5, 10:15,6:20, 8:25, and 10:30 of vancomycin:soy protein). Scanning electron microscope(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS),and FTIR were used for nanoparticle characterization. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by the radial diffusion assay (RDA) and absorbance methods. Propersynthesis was demonstrated by characterization. The best drug loading (%entrapment efficiency = 90.2%), the fastest release rate (% release = 88.2%), andthe best antibacterial activity were observed in ratio 10:30 of vancomycin:SPNs. Results showed that SPNs are a potent delivery system for antibiotic loading and slow release to control antibiotic use.

AB  - Chloasma is a prevalent clinical hyperpigmentation skin disorder that causessymmetrical brown to tan patches on the cheeks, as well as the neck and forearms on rare occasions. The pathophysiology of this condition is complicated, andthere is now no cure. Under the light microscope, the full-thickness melanin ofthe epidermis in the skin lesions was increased, and the dermal chromophagesincreased. At present, the treatment of melasma mainly includes topical drugs,chemical peels, systemic drugs, laser therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. With the development of medical technology, intense pulsed light and Q-switchedlaser have been widely used in the treatment of melasma, which can emit laserbeams to penetrate the dermis uniformly to treat deep pigmented lesions in thedermis. After a stable treatment outcome for melasma is achieved, it is importantto minimize side effects such as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and skinirritation. Therefore, this paper uses a reflection confocal microscope toestablish an evaluation index system and then uses a neural network to evaluatethe treatment effect. The work of this paper is as follows: (1) this paperintroduces various methods of treating melasma at home and abroad and focuses on the application of intense pulsed light therapy and low-energy Q-switched Nd: YAGlaser in the treatment of melasma. (2) In this paper, the case data samples aretrained with the designed BP network to obtain a reliable evaluation networkmodel. (3) The results and mistakes of the evaluation are produced by trainingthe genetic algorithm optimized backpropagation (GA-BP) network structure modelto evaluate the treatment effect of chloasma. Finally, it has been demonstratedthat the GA-BP network has great accuracy and stability.

AB  - , Objective. To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on the biologicalactivity of primary cultured human periodontal ligament cells (PDLC). Methods.The effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on the proliferation activity, protein synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of primary cultured human periodontalligament cells were investigated by thiazole blue (MTT) colorimetric method,Coomassie brilliant blue method, and enzyme kinetics method. The effect ofginsenoside Rg1 on cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry, and the cells were labeled with calcium ion-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo3/AM, and the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on intracellular free calcium concentration was detected by laserscanning confocal microscope. Results. Compared with the control group, theexperimental groups of ginsenoside Rg1 at various concentrations couldsignificantly promote cell proliferation, and the effect time was the longest in the concentration range of 0.01-0.05 mumol/L;, Rg1 0.01umol/L and 0.05umol/L. Theprotein content in the 72-hour cell culture medium of the mumol/L group wassignificantly higher than that of the control group; the ALP activity in the72-hour cell culture medium of the Rg1 0.01 mumol/L, 0.05 mumol/L, and 0.1mumol/L groups was significantly higher than that of the control group; FCM assayshowed that after 0.1 mumol/L Rg1 for 48 hours, compared with the control group, the proportion of cells in the early stage of DNA synthesis (G1%) of PDLC wassignificantly reduced, while the proportion of cells in the DNA synthesis stage(S%) and the value of cell proliferation index PrI (S + G2M)% were significantly increased; Rg1 increased intracellular calcium in PDLC cells at first and thendecreased and finally maintained at a slightly higher resting calcium level than before drug addition. Conclusion. Ginsenoside Rg1 can increase the proliferation activity, protein synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase activity of periodontalligament cells within a certain concentration range; Rg1 reduces the cells in G1 phase and increases cells in S phase of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Change the concentration of free calcium ions in cells and promote more cells to enter aproliferative state.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor (PPARgamma) expression on renal podocyte in diabetic mice byconditionally knockout mouse PPARgamma gene. Methods: Wild-type C57BL mice andPPARgamma gene knockout mice were used as research objects to establish thediabetic mouse model, which was divided into normal control group (NC group),normal glucose PPARgamma gene knockout group (NK group), diabetic wild-type group(DM group), and diabetic PPARgamma gene knockout group (DK group), with 8 mice ineach group. After 16 weeks, the mice were sacrificed for renal tissue collection.Morphological changes of renal tissue were observed by HE and Masson staining,and ultrastructure of renal tissue was observed by transmission electronmicroscope. Protein expressions of PPARgamma, podocin, nephrin, collagen IV, and fibronectin (FN) in renal tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry andWestern blot, and mRNA changes of PPARgamma, podocin, and nephrin in renaltissues were detected by qRT-PCR. Results: Compared with the NC group, theprotein and mRNA expressions of PPARgamma, podocin, and nephrin decreased in the kidney tissue of mice in the DM group, while the protein expressions of collagen IV and FN increased. The expression of various proteins in kidney tissues of the DK group was consistent with that of the DM group, and the difference was moreobvious. The expression of PPARgamma protein and mRNA decreased in the NK group, while the expression of podocin, nephrin protein and mRNA, collagen IV, and FNprotein showed no significant difference. Conclusion: In diabetic renal tissue,the loss of PPARgamma can aggravate podocellular damage and thus promote theoccurrence of diabetic renal fibrosis. Increasing the expression of PPARgamma mayeffectively relieve renal podocyte impairment in diabetic patients, which can be used for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Microscopic imaging and morphometric measurement of fish embryos and larvae isessential in environmental monitoring of fish populations and to evaluate larvae development in aquaculture. Traditional microscopy methods requiretime-consuming, repetitive work by human experts. We present a method for fastimaging and analysis of millimetre-scale ichthyoplankton suspended in seawater.Our system can be easily built from common and off-the-shelf components and uses open-source software for image capture and analysis. Our system obtains images ofsimilar quality to traditional microscopy, and biological measurements comparableto those by human experts, with minimal human interaction. This saves time andeffort, while increasing the size of data sets obtained. We demonstrate ourapproach with cod eggs and larvae, and present results showing biologicallyrelevant endpoints including egg diameter, larval standard length, yolk volumeand eye diameter, with comparison to similar measurements reported in theliterature. * High throughput, microscope-scale imaging of fish eggs and larvae *Automated measurement of biologically relevant endpoints * Easily built fromoff-the-shelf components and open-source software.

TI  - The Anti-Virulence Effect of Sub-Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations ofLevofloxacin on Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae.
PG  - 3513-3522
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S370273 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is best described as avirulent pathogen and generally associated with the hypermucoviscosity phenotype.Increased capsule and aerobactin production are established importanthvKp-specific virulence factors. Although hvKp strains have been relativelysusceptible to antimicrobials, given the high morbidity and mortality, there is acritical need for alternative strategies for the treatment of hvKp infections.Thus, the anti-virulence therapy has been targeted for the hvKp development oftherapeutics. Materials and Methods: Four hvKp isolates with hypermucoviscousphenotype were used in our experiments. Mucoviscosity of the capsule can beassessed by low-speed centrifugation of cultures. CPS amount was determined byglucuronic acid content. The capsule thickness was measured under microscopeafter ink staining. The transcriptions of gene were measured by quantitativereal-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effect of levofloxacin on the resistance of K.pneumoniae to phagocytosis by macrophages and mouse lethality assay was observed.Results: Our data revealed that sub-Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (sub-MIC)of LVX reduce mucoviscosity and CPS production of hvKp. Microscopic observations demonstrated that the capsule of hvkp bacteria became thinned after treatmentwith LVX. qRT-PCR showed decreased transcript levels of rmpA, wzi, magA, iroN andicuA genes. Down-regulation of these virulence genes occurred leading toincreased susceptibility to phagocytosis by macrophages. Mouse lethality assayrevealed that the wild strain had the LD50 of 10(3) CFU, while the sub-MICLVX-treated bacteria had the LD50 of 10(5) CFU. Conclusion: Our data suggestedthat LVX may serve as a potential anti-virulence agent for refractory infectionby hvKp.

TI  - ECERIFERUM 10 Encoding an Enoyl-CoA Reductase Plays a Crucial Role inOsmotolerance and Cuticular Wax Loading in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 898317
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.898317 [doi]
AB  - Acquired osmotolerance induced after salt stress is widespread across Arabidopsisthaliana (Arabidopsis) accessions (e.g., Bu-5). However, it remains unclear howthis osmotolerance is established. Here, we isolated a mutant showing an acquiredosmotolerance-defective phenotype (aod2) from an ion-beam-mutagenized M2population of Bu-5. aod2 was impaired not only in acquired osmotolerance but alsoin osmo-shock, salt-shock, and long-term heat tolerances compared with Bu-5, and it displayed abnormal morphology, including small, wrinkled leaves, andzigzag-shaped stems. Genetic analyses of aod2 revealed that a 439-kbp region ofchromosome 4 was translocated to chromosome 3 at the causal locus for theosmosensitive phenotype. The causal gene of the aod2 phenotype was identical toECERIFERUM 10 (CER10), which encodes an enoyl-coenzyme A reductase that isinvolved in the elongation reactions of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) for subsequent derivatization into cuticular waxes, storage lipids, andsphingolipids. The major components of the cuticular wax were accumulated inresponse to osmotic stress in both Bu-5 WT and aod2. However, less fatty acids,primary alcohols, and aldehydes with chain length >/= C30 were accumulated inaod2. In addition, aod2 exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number ofepicuticular wax crystals on its stems. Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated by bZIP60 was increased in aod2 under osmotic stress. The only cer10 showed the mostpronounced loss of epidermal cuticular wax and most osmosensitive phenotype amongfour Col-0-background cuticular wax-related mutants. Together, the presentfindings suggest that CER10/AOD2 plays a crucial role in Arabidopsisosmotolerance through VLCFA metabolism involved in cuticular wax formation andendocytic membrane trafficking.

AB  - Acquired osmotolerance after salt stress is widespread among Arabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) accessions. Most salt-tolerant accessions exhibit acquiredosmotolerance, whereas Col-0 does not. To identify genes that can confer acquiredosmotolerance to Col-0 plants, we performed full-length cDNA overexpression (FOX)hunting using full-length cDNAs of halophyte Eutrema salsugineum, a closerelative of Arabidopsis. We identified EsCYP78A5 as a gene that can conferacquired osmotolerance to Col-0 wild-type (WT) plants. EsCYP78A5 encodes acytochrome P450 monooxygenase and the Arabidopsis ortholog is known as KLU. Wealso demonstrated that transgenic Col-0 plants overexpressing AtKLU (AtKLUox)exhibited acquired osmotolerance. Interestingly, KLU overexpression improved not only acquired osmotolerance but also osmo-shock, salt-shock, oxidative, andheat-stress tolerances. Under normal conditions, the AtKLUox plants showed growthretardation with shiny green leaves. The AtKLUox plants also accumulated higheranthocyanin levels and developed denser cuticular wax than WT plants. Compared toWT plants, the AtKLUox plants accumulated significantly higher levels of cutinmonomers and very-long-chain fatty acids, which play an important role in thedevelopment of cuticular wax and membrane lipids. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress induced by osmotic or heat stress was reduced in AtKLUox plants comparedto WT plants. These findings suggest that KLU is involved in the cuticlebiosynthesis, accumulation of cuticular wax, and reduction of ER stress inducedby abiotic stresses, leading to the observed abiotic stress tolerances.

AB  - To provide quantitative feedback on surgical progress to ophthalmologistspracticing inner limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, we developed an artificial eye module comprising a quartz crystal resonator (QCR) force sensor and a strain bodythat serves as a uniform force transmitter beneath a retinal model. Although asufficiently large initial force must be loaded onto the QCR force sensorassembly to achieve stable contact with the strain body, the highly sensitive andwide dynamic-range property of this sensor enables the eye module to detect theslight forceps contact force. A parallel-plate strain body is used to achieve auniform force sensitivity over the 4-mm-diameter ILM peeling region. Combiningthese two components allowed for a measurable force range of 0.22 mN to 29.6 Nwith a sensitivity error within -11.3 to 4.2% over the ILM peeling area. Usingthis eye module, we measured the applied force during a simulation involvingartificial ILM peeling by an untrained individual and compensated for thelong-term drift of the obtained force data using a newly developed algorithm. Thecompensated force data clearly captured the characteristics of several types ofmotion sequences observed from video recordings of the eye bottom using anophthalmological microscope. As a result, we succeeded in extracting featurevalues that can be potentially related to trainee skill level, such as the meanand standard deviation of the pushing and peeling forces, corresponding, in thecase of an untrained operator, to 122.6 +/- 95.2 and 20.4 +/- 13.2 mN,respectively.

AB  - It is critical to characterize the degradation products of therapeutic drugs todetermine their safety as these degradation products may possess fatal effects onthe human physiological system. Favipiravir (FVP), a novel anti-Covid-19 drug,that is recently used all over the world with a great impact on humanity was our target to explore more about its toxicity, the margins of its safety, and itsdegradants in different degradation conditions. The goal of this study is toidentify, characterize, and confirm the structures of FVP oxidative and alkaline breakdown products, as well as to assess their safety utilizing in-vitro SRBcytotoxicity assay on normal human skin fibroblasts (NHSF) cell lines. Afteroxidative and alkaline degradation of FVP, one degradation product was producedin each condition which was isolated from FVP using flash chromatography,characterized by (1)HNMR and LC-MS/MS techniques. A reversed-phase Thermo FischerHypersil C18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 m) was used to achieve HPLC chromatographic separation. Acetonitrile-5 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.5) (50:50,v/v) was employed as the mobile phase, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. At 332 nm,the column effluent was measured. Over the concentration range of 0.5-100microg/mL, the calibration curve was linear. The intra-day and inter-day relativestandard deviations were less than 2%, and good percentage recoveries wereobtained that fulfilled the acceptance criteria of the International Conferenceon Harmonization (ICH) recommendations. The Plackett-Burman design was used toassess the robustness. Each degradant was isolated single using Flashchromatography and methylene chloride: methanol gradient mobile phase. Thechemical structures of the degradation products have been confirmed and compared to the intact FVP using (1)H-NMR, and Mass spectroscopy. A postulated mechanismof the degradation process has been depicted and the degradants fragmentationpattern has been portrayed. In addition, the in vitro SRB cytotoxicity assay toevaluate the safety profile of FVP and the degradation end products showed their high safety margin in both conditions with IC50 >100 microg/ml with no signs oftoxicity upon examination of the treated NHSF cells under the optical microscope.

AB  - Background Endodontic hand files are used during root canal treatment in thecleaning and shaping step of the procedure. Whether endodontic instruments shouldbe single-use or reusable is a topic of debate. This in vitro study aimed toanalyze the bioburden on used and new sterilized endodontic hand files.Methodology A total of 30 K-files (15 used, 15 new) and 30 H-files (15 used, 15new) were studied. After clinical use, the used and new files were subjected tophloxine B staining, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, and microbialculture. We used a Fisher's exact test to investigate the significant difference in contamination and bioburden between new and used endodontic files. Results Thechi-square test showed no statistically significant difference between new andused groups in staining. In the used group, 20% of the H-files and 6.7% of theK-files were positive for bioburden (p > 0.05). The SEM analysis showed that all used files (100%) were contaminated with biological debris. All new files andmost of the used files (86.7%) were negative for bacterial culture. ConclusionsUsed K-files and H-files (sizes 25 and below) had greater contamination andbioburden than new files. Our results highlight the inadequacy of cleaningmethods (mechanical/ultrasonication pre-cleaning and heat sterilization) employedbetween re-usage of files in this study. Appropriate decision-making on eitheradapting an evidence-based and effective reprocessing strategy or single-usefiles can be considered by dentists.

AB  - The present study summarizes the current literature on the presence and thestructure of biogenic amorphous silica (BAS) in nature. Based on this review, it is shown that BAS is ubiquitous in nature and exhibits a structure that cannot bedifferentiated from the structure of synthetic amorphous silica (SAS). Thestructural similarity of BAS and SAS is further supported by ourinvestigations-in particular, specific surface area (BET) and electron microscopetechniques-on oat husk and common horsetail. Many food products containing BASare considered to be beneficial to health. In the context of the use of SAS inspecific applications (e.g., food, feed, and cosmetics), this is of particularinterest for discussions of the safety of these uses.

AB  - Croton stellatopilosus (Plaunoi) leaves accumulate several diterpenes and possessvarious pharmacological activities. The present study aimed to prepare,characterize and assess the antibacterial activity of inclusion complexesprepared by mixing plaunotol (PL) or plaunoi extract (PE) with cyclodextrins(CD), including alpha-CD, beta-CD, gamma-CD, and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). The inclusion complexes were characterized using SEM, XRD, DSC, andFT-IR and evaluated for aqueous solubility and thermal stability. The PL and PElyophilized complexes with HP-beta-CD were further evaluated for theirantibacterial activity against acne-causing bacteria. The minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of PL, PE,and the inclusion complexes evaluated using the agar dilution method revealedthat the MIC and MBC values of the inclusion complexes were lower than those ofPL or PE alone. Interestingly, the complexes had a synergistic activity withclindamycin after testing with checkerboard assay. The hydrogel containing theinclusion complex and clindamycin were assessed for antibacterial activity using the agar well diffusion method. The results indicated that the hydrogels showedsignificant inhibition of bacterial growth. In conclusion, the prepared soliddispersion of PL or PE with HP-beta-CD could enhance antibacterial activity byincreasing the drug solubility. The hydrogels containing PL or PE complex andclindamycin could be considered as a candidate for the treatment of acnevulgaris.

TI  - A Chemosensor of 1,8-Dihydroxyanthraquinone PMOs Prepared in a Ternary DeepEutectic Solvent for the Sensitive Detection of Cu(2).
PG  - 22613-22625
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01944 [doi]
AB  - A novel type of organic-inorganic hybrid periodic mesoporous materials based on1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ-PMOs) was synthesized in a ternary deep eutecticsolvent (DES). In the process of the material synthesis, an organosiloxaneprecursor (DHAQ-Si) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) were used as the mixed Si source, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as the structuredirecting agent. The DES formed by choline chloride (ChCl), urea (U), andethylene glycol (EG) was used as a green solvent. The water needed for thehydrolysis of DHAQ-Si and TEOS was provided from free water in the sodiumhydroxide solution. As characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, nitrogenadsorption/desorption isotherms, and high-resolution transmission electronmicroscopy, the obtained mesoporous materials exhibit a two-dimensional hexagonal(P6mm) structure. DHAQ possesses double fluorescence emission peaks at ca. 520and 580 nm due to the effect of the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). For DHAQ-PMOs, the silica framework can provide a rigid environment thatmakes the fluorescence properties more stable and the fluorescence emission peak appears to red-shift obviously. The DHAQ-PMOs have high selectivity andsensitivity in a wide pH range that can be used to detect Cu(2+), and the limitof detection (LOD) is as low as 2.39 x 10(-9) M. Fluorescence polarizationexperiments, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy were used to study the coordination interaction between DHAQ andCu(2+). The density functional theory (DFT) was used to further prove thecoordination ability and interaction between DHAQ and Cu(2+). XPS spectra werealso done to prove the coordination of DHAQ and DHAQ-PMO-10 with Cu(2+). Inaddition, confocal fluorescence microscope images exhibit that DHAQ-PMOs candetect Cu(2+) in living cells. The results show that DHAQ-PMOs have greatapplication potential as a sensor for the detection of Cu(2+).

TI  - Coal Structure Characteristics in the Northern Qinshui Basin and TheirDiscrimination Method Based on the Particle Size of Drilling Cuttings.
PG  - 22956-22968
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c03017 [doi]
AB  - Coal structure, including primary coal, cataclastic coal, granulated coal, andmylonitized coal, is one of the key factors controlling coal and gas outburst,and it also determines the efficiency of coalbed methane (CBM) extraction.Therefore, it is significant to identify the characteristics of coal structuresand to predict them in advance. In this work, the spatial distribution,mechanical properties, and microscopic morphology of the four coal structuresfrom the No. 3 coal seam of the Xinyuan Mine in the northern part of the Qinshui Basin were investigated through the in situ observation in the roadway, thehardness coefficient (f) test, and the scanning electron microscope analysis.Moreover, the drilling cuttings from the gas pressure releasing holes weresampled and sieved, and then, the correspondence between different coalstructures and the particle size of the cuttings was analyzed quantitativelybased on the Rosin-Rammler model. The result shows that the spatial distribution of the coal structure has strong heterogeneity in the vertical and lateraldirections. The f value decreases successively with the increase in coalstructure deformation, which indicate that f can directly characterize the coalstructure. Furthermore, the relations between f and drilling cutting averageparticle size (d 0), crushability indicator (n), crushing degree index (lambda), and the median diameter (d 50) were established. Specifically, the coaldeformation degree is positively correlated with the mass fraction of largeparticles in the cuttings under the same drilling parameters. Overall, as fincreases, d 0 and d 50 decrease, and n and lambda increase. However, parameters d 0, d 50, and lambda of granulated coal are inconsistent with other coalstructures, and mylonitized coal is inconsistent with other coal structures in n,as a result of the coal structure broken characteristics itself and thedifference in the stress state between the coal and the drill bit during the rockbreaking process. Ultimately, the coal structures determined by the surface CBMwell logging curve and the cuttings particle size method were compared, and they have a high degree of coincidence in the distinction between primary coal andtectonic coal.

AB  - In order to study the vascular density and retinal thickness of myopic children, a depth study was carried out on the basis of OCTA microscope. Through themethods of prospective cross-sectional research, statistical analysis, and basic data comparison, the research examination of myopia children under OCTA wassuccessfully analyzed. There were significant differences in the density ofsuperficial capillaries in the whole macular region, inner ring, temporal side ofinner ring, and nasal side (P = 0.033, 0.024, 0.018, 0.032), and there was nosignificant difference in other ranges (P > 0.05). Macular fovea, as the mostsensitive part of the retina, has pathological changes, which will also lead toserious negative effects on vision. The limitations of cross-sectional studiesinclude the results of a relatively small sample size. After the study of OCTA inthe macular region of children with myopia, it is related to the progressiveatrophy of the retina and choroid in the macular region. When there are obviouspathological changes in the macular region, the thickness of the macular regionbecomes significantly thinner. We found that there was a positive correlationbetween retinal vascular density and retinal thickness in the fovea and above of myopia. The retinal thickness of the whole macular region, the inner ring and itsfour quadrants, and the outer ring and its four quadrants were positivelycorrelated with SE (standard error) (all P < 0.05); Foveal ring retinal thicknesswas not associated with SE.

LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.936142 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling controls bothphysiological and pathogenetic responses in the vasculature. In mouse models ofLoeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), a hereditary disorder characterized by aggressiveaortic aneurysms, treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) preventsaortic root dilation and associated histological alterations. In this study weuse germline and conditional genetic inactivation of Agtr1a (coding for the AT1a receptor) to assess the effect of systemic and localized AT1R signalingattenuation on aortic disease in a mouse model of LDS (Tgfbr1 (M318R/+)). Aortic diameters and histological features were examined in control and Tgfbr1 (M318R/+)mice with either germline or Mef2C (SHF) -Cre mediated genetic inactivation ofAgtr1a, the latter resulting in deletion in second heart field (SHF)-derivedlineages in the aortic root and proximal aorta. Both systemic and regional AT1Rsignaling attenuation resulted in reduction of diameters and improvement oftissue morphology in the aortic root of LDS mice; these outcomes were associated with reduced levels of Smad2/3 and ERK phosphorylation, signaling eventspreviously linked to aortic disease in LDS. However, regional AT1a inactivationin SHF-derived lineages resulted in a more modest reduction in aortic diametersrelative to the more complete effect of germline Agtr1a deletion, which was also associated with lower blood pressure. Our findings suggest that the therapeuticeffects of AT1R antagonisms in preclinical models of aortic disease depend onboth regional and systemic factors and suggest that combinatorial approachestargeting both processes may prove beneficial for aneurysm mitigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: D-alanylation of Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is considered to beessential for virulence factors expression in Gram-positive microorganism. Theeffects of the D-alanylation of LTA on biofilm formation and acidogenesis ofStreptococcus mutans (S. mutans) are still not clearly understood. AIM: Thisstudy was designed to investigate the impact of D-alanylation of LTA on biofilmformation and acidogenesis of S. mutans and explore the related mechanisms.METHODS AND MATERIAL: We compared the biofilm formation process by fluorescencemicroscope observation of LTA D-alanylation blocking strain with that of thewildtype strain. Auto-aggregation, cell surface charge, and polysaccharideproduction assays were performed to investigate the related mechanisms. pH dropassay and glycolysis pH drop-down analysis were carried out to evaluate theacidogenesis capacity of S. mutans after LTA D-alanylation blocking. To identify the biofilm formation and adhesive-related genes expressions of S. mutans mutant,qRT-PCR was performed. RESULTS: After blocking off the D-alanylation of LTA, S.mutans could not form the three-dimensional structural biofilm, in which cellswere scattered on the substratum as small clusters. The auto-aggregation wasprompted due to the mutant strain cell morphology change (*p < 0.05).Furthermore, more negative charges were found on the mutant strain cells surfacesand fewer water-insoluble glucans were produced in mutant biofilm (*p < 0.05).The adhesion capacity of the S. mutans biofilm was impaired after LTAD-alanylation blocking (*p < 0.05). Biofilm formation and adhesive-related genes expressions decreased (*p < 0.05), especially at the early stages of biofilmformation. S. mutans mutant strains exhibited suppressed acidogenesis because itsglycolytic activity was impaired. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggestthat blocking of LTA D-alanylation disrupts normal biofilm formation in S. mutanspredominantly if not entirely by altering intercellular auto-aggregation, celladhesion, and extracellular matrix formation. Moreover, our study results suggestthat the LTA D-alanylation plays an important role in S. mutans acidogenesis byaltering glycolytic activity. These findings add to the knowledge aboutmechanisms underlying biofilm formation and acid tolerance in S. mutans.

AB  - Lipidic carriers are efficient vehicles preserving drugs during celladministration. Several production processes of lipidic nanoparticles weredeveloped to reduce mean size at nanometric level, enhancing homogeneity andprocess replicability. However, lipidic aggregation has always been considered a huge drawback in terms of high polidispersity and instability. Looking at thisproblem from a different point of view, specific operating parameters wereemployed to produce Nanostructured Lipidic Carriers (NLC), whose structuresimulates the complexity of cell barrier. NLC present high surface to volumeratio, and improved potential in terms of drug entrapment efficiency andbioavailability. In this work, NLCs were produced by studying the effect ofprocess parameters, such as Drug to Lipid Ratio from 2:1-1:20 w/w. At macroscopiclevel, the NLCs produced showed these diameters distribution: D(10 %) from 85 nm to 6 microm, D(50 %) of about 10 microm and D(90 %) of about 31 microm.Encapsulation Efficiencies were measured from a minimum of 92.06 % to a maximumof 98.93 %, with mass yield included between 48.8 % and 99 %. Scanning ElectronMicroscope demonstrated the complexity of the shape of these NLCs, characterized by nanometric structures (100-500 nm) grab on Q10 "pillars" or adsorbed onlipidic external sheet.

AB  - Ticks are very harmful blood sucking protozoans and rickettsial diseases inlivestock and cause an adverse economy of the world, including tropical regionslike Nepal. Thus, the current study was conducted to determine the distribution, prevalence, and the effects of ticks in the goat of the Rapti Municipality,Chitwan, Nepal. Ticks were picked from different body parts of goats (n=473) and identified to species level by using morphological identification keys under amicroscope. The study revealed that 161 (34%) of goats were infested and females had highest prevalence of ticks compared to males (41% vs 28%). A total of 14species of ticks of genera Haemaphysalis, Amblyomma, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes andDermacentor were identified. All tick-positive goats were suffered from inflamed wounds with various skin manifestations. In conclusion, this study suggested thatappropriate control measures for ticks need to be employed in the study area for economic goat production.

AB  - An optimized mixture of polydopamine (PDA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) isemployed as the surface functionalizing agent and reducing agent to encapsulateindividual polypropylene (PP) fibers of polypropylene micromembrane (PPMM). Thefunctionalized PPMM becomes hydrophilic to allow the formation of Au nuclei forsubsequent electroless Au deposition. The metalized PPMM is further depositedwith IrO2 nanoparticles, and evaluated as a flexible and porous pH sensor. Imagesfrom scanning electron microscope confirms the uniform formation of IrO2nanoparticles on Au-coated PP fibers. For pH-sensing performance, theIrO2-decorated metalized PPMM reveals a super-Nernstian response for a sensingslope of -74.45 mV/pH in aqueous solutions with pH value ranging between 2 and12. In addition, the pH-sensing performance is properly maintained after 5000bending cycles and hysteresis is modest in an acidic environment. The cellviability test indicates a negligible bio-toxicity. Our strategy of using aconductive polymeric membrane decorated with IrO2 nanoparticles enables possible sensing applications in wearable and implantable electronics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this report, we discuss the evaluation of a patient with chronicscrotal pain found to have a supernumerary testis (SNT), as well as a novelmicrosurgical approach to safely removing this testis. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: To avoid any iatrogenic injury to the adjacent testis, we used an operatingmicroscope to visualize the cord structures of both testes and carefully removethe smaller, atrophic, supernumerary testis. The surgery was successfullycompleted without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. Totaloperative time was 2 hours. While the patient had not yet attempted to conceiveat the time of follow-up, given our careful dissection, we expect him to havenormal testicular function and fertility in the future. CONCLUSION: This casedemonstrates a novel microsurgical approach to excising a supernumerary testisthat avoids injury to the blood supply, epididymis, and vas deferens associatedwith the normal testis.

AB  - Harsh environments enforce the expression of behavioural, morphological,physiological, and reproductive rejoinders, including torpor. Here we study themorphological, cellular, and molecular alterations in torpor architype in thecolonial urochordate Botrylloides aff. leachii by employing whole organismTransmission electron (TEM) and light microscope observations, RNA sequencing,real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) quantification of selected genes, and immunolocalization of WNT, SMAD and SOX2 gene expressions. On the morphologicallevel, torpor starts with gradual regression of all zooids and buds which leaves the colony surviving as condensed vasculature remnants that may be 'aroused' toregenerate fully functional colonies upon changes in the environment.Simultaneously, we observed altered distributions of hemolymph cell types.Phagocytes doubled in number, while the number of morula cells declined by half. In addition, two new circulating cell types were observed, multi-nucleated andbacteria-bearing cells. RNA sequencing technology revealed marked differences in gene expression between different organism compartments and states: active zooidsand ampullae, and between mid-torpor and naive colonies, or naive and torpidcolonies. Gene Ontology term enrichment analyses further showed disparatebiological processes. In torpid colonies, we observed overall 233 up regulatedgenes. These genes included NR4A2, EGR1, MUC5AC, HMCN2 and. Also, 27transcription factors were upregulated in torpid colonies including ELK1, HDAC3, RBMX, MAZ, STAT1, STAT4 and STAT6. Interestingly, genes involved in developmentalprocesses such as SPIRE1, RHOA, SOX11, WNT5A and SNX18 were also upregulated intorpid colonies. We further validated the dysregulation of 22 genes during torporby utilizing qPCR. Immunohistochemistry of representative genes from threesignaling pathways revealed high expression of these genes in circulated cellsalong torpor. WNT agonist administration resulted in early arousal from torpor in80% of the torpid colonies while in active colonies WNT agonist triggered thetorpor state. Abovementioned results thus connote unique transcriptome landscapesassociated with Botrylloides leachii torpor.

AB  - The abuse of antibiotics would seriously affect human health and has become ofworldwide critical concern, thus it is urgent to develop an environmentallyfriendly and nontoxic fluorescent probe for antibiotics sensing. In this work, a lead-free Cs2ZnCl4 perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) probe was fabricated forsensing norfloxacin (NOR) employing a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitationmethod. The prepared Cs2ZnCl4 PNCs probe had strong blue emission around 440 nm, and the characteristics of PNCs were systematically characterized by X-rayphotoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction(XRD). The results revealed that the fluorescence intensity of the Cs2ZnCl4 PNCs was significantly enhanced after the introduction of norfloxacin. The Cs2ZnCl4PNCs can be used as a fluorescent probe to selectively and sensitively detectnorfloxacin in the concentration range from 0.2 to 50.0 muM, with a correlationcoefficient (R(2)) of 0.9954 and the limit of detection (LOD, 3sigma) of 0.1499microM. The preparation and application of a lead-free perovskite fluorescentprobe for norfloxacin would promote the application of perovskite fluorescentprobes in biochemical assays.

LID - 10.3390/polym14132727 [doi]
AB  - A novel and cost-effective method for the fabrication of highly conductive Al/Ag core-shell structured microspheres was proposed and investigated. The oxidativeco-deposition of catechol and polyamine was firstly performed to modify thesurface of the aluminum microsphere. Then, a two-step electroless plating wasconducted to fabricate the Al/Ag microspheres. During the first step of theelectroless plating process, the surface of the aluminum microsphere wasdeposited with silver nanoparticle seeds using n-octylamine and ethylene glycol. Then, during the second step of the electroless plating process, silver particlesgrew evenly to form a compact silver shell on the surface of aluminum via asilver mirror reaction. According to the scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray results, a compact and continuous silver layer was successfully generated on the surface of the aluminum. The valence of the sliver on thesurface of the aluminum was confirmed to be zero, based on the X-rayphotoelectron spectrometer and X-ray diffractometer analyses. As a result, theas-prepared Al/Ag microspheres exhibited a high conductivity of 10,000 S/cm. The Al/Ag/MVQ composite demonstrated low electrical resistivity of 0.0039 Omega.cmand great electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness at more than 70 dBagainst the X-band, and this result suggests that the as-prepared composite is a promising conductive and electromagnetic shielding material.

TI  - Triaxial Mechanical Properties and Mechanism of WaterbornePolyurethane-Reinforced Road Demolition Waste as Road Bases.
LID - 2725 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14132725 [doi]
AB  - The recycling and reuse of construction waste have not only effectively protectednatural resources but also promoted the sustainable development of theenvironment. Therefore, in this article, waterborne polyurethane (WPU) as apromising new polymer reinforcement material was proposed to reinforce the roaddemolition waste (RDW), and the mechanical performance of WPU-reinforced RDW(named PURD) was investigated using triaxial unconsolidated and undrained shear(UU) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) tests. The results showed that under the same curing time and confining pressure, the shear strength of PURD increasedwith the increase in WPU content. When the WPU content was 6%, the WPU presented the best reinforcement effect on RA. The failure strain of PURD increased withthe increase in confining pressure, but increased first and then reduced with theincrease in WPU content. The specimens with 5% WPU content showed the bestductility. At the curing time of 7 and 28 days, the internal friction angle andcohesion of PURD increased with the increase in WPU content, and they reached amaximum when the WPU content was 6%. The internal friction angle barely budged,but the cohesion increased obviously. The enhancement effect of WPU wasattributed to the spatial reticular membrane structure produced by wrapping andbonding particles with the WPU film. Microscopic analysis showed that with theincrease in WPU content, the internal pore and crack size of PURD graduallydecreased. As the WPU content increased, the WPU film became increasinglythicker, which increased the adhesion between WPU and RA particles and made thestructure of PURD become increasingly denser.

TI  - Effect of Maintenance and Water-Cement Ratio on Foamed Concrete ShrinkageCracking.
LID - 2703 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14132703 [doi]
AB  - This is a study on how to reduce shrinkage and improve crack resistance of foamedconcrete. By selecting different curing temperatures and humidity, six different curing conditions were analyzed. The shrinkage deformation and maximum crackwidth of foamed concrete blocks with water-cement ratios of 0.4 and 0.5, undersix curing conditions, were measured by a comparator and optical microscope, and the cracking time was recorded. The effects of curing temperature, humidity andwater-cement ratio on the shrinkage and crack resistance of the foamed concretewere analyzed by comparing the experimental results of each group. We studied theprimary and secondary order of the three factors affecting the drying shrinkageof foamed concrete. The results show that: temperature is the primary factor thatchanges the drying shrinkage performance of foamed concrete, followed by thewater-cement ratio, and finally humidity. The interaction of these three factors is not obvious. The shrinkage of foamed concrete increases with the increase intemperature; increasing the humidity of curing can control the water loss rate offoamed concrete and reduce shrinkage. Lower humidity and higher temperature will make cracks appear earlier; with an increase in the water-cement ratio, theinitial cracking time is shortened and the cracking property of foamed concreteis improved.

LID - 2612 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14132612 [doi]
AB  - The impact of matrix material on the mechanical properties ofnatural-fiber-reinforced hybrid composites was studied by comparing theirexperimental, and numerical analysis results. In the present work hemp and flaxfibers were used as reinforcement and epoxy resin and ecopoxy resin along withhardener were used as matrix materials. To study the influence of the matrixmaterial, two sets of hybrid composites were fabricated by varying the matrixmaterial. The composite samples were fabricated by using the compression-molding technique followed by a hand layup process. A total of five different composites were fabricated by varying the weight fraction of fiber material in each setbased on the rule of the hybridization process. After fabrication, the mechanicalproperties of the composite samples were tested and morphological studies wereanalyzed by using SEM-EDX analysis. The flexural-test fractured specimens wereanalyzed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In addition, theoretical analysis of the elastic properties of hybrid composites was carried out by using the Halpin-Tsai approach. The results showed that the hybrid composites hadsuperior properties to individual fiber composites. Overall, epoxy resin matrixcomposites exhibited superior properties to ecopoxy matrix composites.

AB  - Gelatin, one of the most abundant, naturally derived biomacromolecules fromcollagen, is widely applicable in food additives, cosmetic ingredients, drugformulation, and wound dressing based on their non-toxicity and biodegradability.In parallel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a synthetic polymer, has been commonlyapplied as a thickening agent for coating processes in aqueous systems and amajor component in healthcare products for cartilage replacements, eyelubrication, and contact lenses. In this study, a new type of mixed hydrogelnanofiber was fabricated from gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol by electrospinningunder a feasible range of polymer compositions. To determine the optimalcomposition of gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol in nanofiber fabrication, severalkey physicochemical properties of mixed polymer solutions such as viscosity,surface tension, pH, and electrical conductance were thoroughly characterized by a viscometer, surface tensiometer, water analyzer, and carbon electron probe.Moreover, the molecular structures of polymeric chains within mixed hydrogelnanofibers were investigated with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Themorphologies and surface elemental compositions of the mixed hydrogel nanofibers were examined by the scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-rayspectroscopy, respectively. The measurement of water contact angles was performedfor measuring the hydrophilicity of nanofiber surfaces. Most importantly, thepotential cytotoxicity of the electrospun nanofibers was evaluated by the invitro culture of 3T3 fibroblasts. Through our extensive study, it was found that a PVA-rich solution (a volumetric ratio of gelatin/polyvinyl alcohol &lt;1) wouldbe superior for the efficient production of mixed hydrogel nanofibers byelectrospinning techniques. This result is due to the appropriate balance betweenthe higher viscosity (~420-~4300 10(-2) poise) and slightly lower surface tension(~35.12-~32.68 mN/m(2)) of the mixed polymer solution. The regression on theviscosity data also found a good fit by the Lederer-Rougier's model for a binary mixture. For the hydrophilicity of nanofibers, the numerical analysis estimatesthat the value of interfacial energy for the water contact on nanofibers isaround ~-0.028 to ~-0.059 J/m(2).

LID - 10.3390/polym14132546 [doi]
AB  - Pristine and doped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are actively investigated for abroad range of applications in pressure sensing, energy harvesting, transducers, porous membranes, etc. There have been numerous reports on the improvedpiezoelectric and electric performance of PVDF-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)structures. However, the common in situ doping methods have proven to beexpensive and less desirable. Furthermore, there is a lack of explicit extractionof the compression mode piezoelectric coefficient (d33) in ex situ rGO doped PVDFcomposite films prepared using low-cost, solution-cast processes. In this work,we describe an optimal procedure for preparing high-quality pristine andnano-composite PVDF films using solution-casting and thermal poling. We thenverify their electromechanical properties by rigorously characterizing beta-phaseconcentration, crystallinity, piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric permittivity,and loss tangent. We also demonstrate a novel stationary atomic force microscope (AFM) technique designed to reduce non-piezoelectric influences on the extractionof d33 in PVDF films. We then discuss the benefits of our d33 measurementstechnique over commercially sourced piezometers and conventional piezoforcemicroscopy (PFM). Characterization outcomes from our in-house synthesized filmsdemonstrate that the introduction of 0.3%w.t. rGO nanoparticles in asolution-cast only marginally changes the beta-phase concentration from 83.7% to 81.7% and decreases the crystallinity from 42.4% to 37.3%, whereas dopingincreases the piezoelectric coefficient by 28% from d33 = 45 pm/V to d33 = 58pm/V, while also improving the dielectric by 28%. The piezoelectric coefficients of our films were generally higher but comparable to other in situ preparedPVDF/rGO composite films, while the dielectric permittivity and beta-phaseconcentrations were found to be lower.

TI  - Dynamic Mode Decomposition of Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching Microscopy Datafor Model-Free Analysis of Protein Transport and Aggregation in Living Cells.
LID - 4731 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22134731 [doi]
AB  - The phase separation and aggregation of proteins are hallmarks of manyneurodegenerative diseases. These processes can be studied in living cells using fluorescent protein constructs and quantitative live-cell imaging techniques,such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or the relatedfluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). While the acquisition of FLIP images is straightforward on most commercial confocal microscope systems, the analysisand computational modeling of such data is challenging. Here, a novel model-free method is presented, which resolves complex spatiotemporal fluorescence-losskinetics based on dynamic-mode decomposition (DMD) of FLIP live-cell imagesequences. It is shown that the DMD of synthetic and experimental FLIP imageseries (DMD-FLIP) allows for the unequivocal discrimination of subcellularcompartments, such as nuclei, cytoplasm, and protein condensates based on theirdiffering transport and therefore fluorescence loss kinetics. By decomposingfluorescence-loss kinetics into distinct dynamic modes, DMD-FLIP will enableresearchers to study protein dynamics at each time scale individually.Furthermore, it is shown that DMD-FLIP is very efficient in denoising confocaltime series data. Thus, DMD-FLIP is an easy-to-use method for the model-freedetection of barriers to protein diffusion, of phase-separated proteinassemblies, and of insoluble protein aggregates. It should, therefore, find wide application in the analysis of protein transport and aggregation, in particularin relation to neurodegenerative diseases and the formation of proteincondensates in living cells.

LID - 10.3390/nano12132298 [doi]
AB  - To enhance the utilization efficiency of visible light and reduce therecombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, spindle-shaped TiO2photocatalysts with different Ti(3+) concentrations were fabricated by a simplesolvothermal strategy using low-cost, environmentally friendly TiH2 and H2O2 asraw materials and triethanolamine-aqueous as the medium. The photocatalyticactivities of the obtained photocatalysts were investigated in the presence ofvisible light. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, transmission electronmicroscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transforminfrared (FT-IR) spectra were applied to characterize the structure,morphologies, and chemical compositions of as-fabricated Ti(3+) self-doped TiO2. The concentration of triethanolamine in the mixed solvent plays a significantrole on the crystallinity, morphologies, and photocatalytic activities. Theelectron-hole separation efficiency was found to increase with the increase inthe aspect ratio of as-fabricated Ti(3+) self-doped TiO2, which was proved bytransient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

LID - 10.3390/nano12132294 [doi]
AB  - Here, the controlled formation of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and silvernanoparticles (AgNPs) using amine-functionalized multivalent ligands arereported. The effects of reaction temperature and ligand multivalency on thegrowth kinetics, size, and shape of PtNPs and AgNPs were systematically studiedby performing a stepwise and a one-step process. PtNPs and AgNPs were prepared inthe presence of amine ligands using platinum (II) acetylacetonate and silver (I) acetylacetonate, respectively. The effects of ligands and temperature on theformation of PtNPs were studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).For the characterization of AgNPs, additionally, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)absorption was employed. The TEM measurements revealed that PtNPs prepared atdifferent temperatures (160-200 degrees C, in a stepwise process) aremonodispersed and of spherical shape regardless of the ligand multivalency orreaction temperature. In the preparation of PtNPs by the one-step process,ligands affect the shape of the PtNPs, which can be explained by the affinity of the ligands. The TEM and UV-Vis absorption studies on the formation of AgNPs withmono-, di-, and trivalent ligands showed narrower size distributions, whileincreasing the temperature from 80 degrees C to 120 degrees C and with atrivalent ligand in a one-step process.

AB  - The epitaxial deposition of a precise number, or even fractions, of monolayers ofindium (In)-rich semiconductors onto gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates enablesthe creation of quantum dots based on InAs, InGaAs and indium phosphide (InP) forinfrared light-emitting and laser diodes and the formation of indium antimonide(InSb)/GaAs strained layer superlattices. Here, a facile method based onenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) in a scanning electron microscope(SEM) is presented that allows the indium content of a single semiconductor layerdeposited on a gallium arsenide substrate to be measured with relatively highaccuracy (+/-0.7 monolayers). As the procedure works in top-down geometry, where any part of a wafer can be inspected, measuring the In content of the surfacelayer in one location without destroying it can also be used to map the lateralindium distribution during quantum dot formation and is a method suitable as anin-situ quality control tool for epitaxy.

LID - 10.3390/nano12132211 [doi]
AB  - In this work, a thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) thin film on microscopic glass was prepared using spray coating and atmospheric pressure chemical vapourdeposition. The structure of TRGO was analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD)spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-rayspectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, andultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) suggesting a decrease in oxygenfunctional groups (OFGs), leading to the restacking, change in colour, andtransparency of the graphene sheets. Raman spectrum deconvolution detailed thefilm's parameters, such as the crystallite size, degree of defect, degree ofamorphousness, and type of defect. The electrochemical performance of themicrosupercapacitor (micro-SC) showed a rectangular cyclic voltammetry shape,which was maintained at a high scan rate, revealing phenomenal electricdouble-layer capacitor (EDLC) behaviour. The power law and Trasatti's analysisindicated that low-temperature TRGO micro-SC is dominated by diffusion-controlledbehaviour, while higher temperature TRGO micro-SC is dominated bysurface-controlled behaviour.

TI  - Zirconia-Doped Methylated Silica Membranes via Sol-Gel Process: Microstructureand Hydrogen Permselectivity.
LID - 2159 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12132159 [doi]
AB  - In order to obtain a steam-stable hydrogen permselectivity membrane, withtetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silicon source, zirconium nitratepentahydrate (Zr(NO3)4.5H2O) as the zirconium source, and methyltriethoxysilane(MTES) as the hydrophobic modifier, the methyl-modified ZrO2-SiO2 (ZrO2-MSiO2)membranes were prepared via the sol-gel method. The microstructure and gaspermeance of the ZrO2-MSiO2 membranes were studied. The physical-chemicalproperties of the membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction(XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope(SEM), and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The hydrogen permselectivity ofZrO2-MSiO2 membranes was evaluated with Zr content, temperature, pressuredifference, drying control chemical additive (glycerol) content, and hydrothermalstability as the inferred factors. XRD and pore structure analysis revealed that,as nZr increased, the MSiO2 peak gradually shifted to a higher 2theta value, and the intensity gradually decreased. The study found that the permeation mechanism of H2 and other gases is mainly based on the activation-diffusion mechanism. The separation of H2 is facilitated by an increase in temperature. The ZrO2-MSiO2membrane with nZr = 0.15 has a better pore structure and a suitable ratio ofmicropores to mesopores, which improved the gas permselectivities. At 200 degreesC, the H2 permeance of MSiO2 and ZrO2-MSiO2 membranes was 3.66 x 10(-6) and 6.46 x 10(-6) mol.m(-2).s(-1).Pa(-1), respectively. Compared with the MSiO2 membrane, the H2/CO2 and H2/N2 permselectivities of the ZrO2-MSiO2 membrane were improvedby 79.18% and 26.75%, respectively. The added amount of glycerol as the dryingcontrol chemical additive increased from 20% to 30%, the permeance of H2decreased by 11.55%, and the permselectivities of H2/CO2 and H2/N2 rose by 2.14% and 0.28%, respectively. The final results demonstrate that the ZrO2-MSiO2membrane possesses excellent hydrothermal stability and regeneration capability.

LID - 10.3390/plants11131719 [doi]
AB  - Two wild populations of Helichrysum (Mill.) located at Elba Island (TuscanArchipelago, Central Italy) were morphologically and phytochemically analyzed to taxonomically identify H. litoreum (population A) and H. italicum subsp. italicum(population B). Micromorphological and histochemical analyses were performed onthe indumentum using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Light Microscope(LM). Morphometric analyses on vegetative and reproductive traits were alsoconducted. Finally, a chemotaxonomic analysis was carried out on the terpeneprofile of flowers, leaves and bark tissues using gas chromatography (GC-MS).Results suggested that morphological discriminant traits were mainly in leavesand cypselae glandular tissues. Phytochemical analysis indicated that a highrelative content of alpha-pinene and beta-caryophyllene were the main markers forpopulation A, while a high relative content of neryl-acetate, alpha-curcumene,isoitalicene and italicene, especially in the terpene profile of bark tissue,were the main compounds for discriminating population B. The analysis suggestedthat the wild population A could be mainly ascribed to H. litoreum, whilstpopulation B is defined by H. italicum.

LID - 10.3390/plants11131678 [doi]
AB  - The results of the computational and the physicochemical studies of theencapsulation of resveratrol with beta-cyclodextrin are presented here. At first,the molecular docking experiments predicted good binding. Several MD simulations and MM-PBSA experiments confirmed the reliable binding, showing optimal kinetics and energy. As an application, resveratrol inclusion complexes withbeta-cyclodextrin were obtained in an aqueous alcohol medium via microwavetreatment. The results of thermographic measurements of the obtained clathratesusing a differential scanning calorimeter are presented, and the obtainedactivation energy was calculated using the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Friedman methods,as well as nonparametric kinetics. The effect of complexation on the kineticparameters of thermal destruction of the beta-cyclodextrin-resveratrol inclusion complex was considered. The morphology of the surface of the obtained clathratecomplexes was described using a scanning electron microscope. The spectralproperties of the inclusion complex were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H, and(13)capital ES, Cyrillic NMR spectroscopic data. The obtained in silico,morphological, thermogravimetric, and spectral results confirmed the formation ofthe resveratrol-beta-cyclodextrin complex. The antioxidant activities of theinclusion complex were determined to be 12.1 mug/mL, compared to 14.3 mug/mL for free resveratrol, indicating an improvement in the bioactivity.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134299 [doi]
AB  - Red Malus 'Royalty' fruits are rich in anthocyanins. This study aimed to obtainthe optimal parameters for the extraction and separation of anthocyanins fromMalus 'Royalty' fruits and to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the enrichedanthocyanin fraction on gastric cancer cells. Ultrasonic-assisted extraction was used for the extraction of the anthocyanins of Malus 'Royalty' fruit, and theextraction results showed that the optimum parameters were an extractiontemperature of 20 degrees C, a solid-liquid ratio of 1:6 (g/mL), ethanol andformic acid contents of 70% and 0.4%, respectively, an extraction time of 40 min,and an ultrasonic power of 300 W. The optimum extraction parameters to achievethe highest anthocyanin yield by a single-factor experiment coupled with responsesurface methodology were identified. The separation results showed that the AB-8 macroporous resin was a better purifying material, with 60% ethanol as anadsorbent, and the adsorption-desorption equilibrium times were 6 h and 1 h,respectively. Cyanidin-3-galactoside was the main body composition separation of anthocyanins by a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector.The antitumor activity results showed that the anthocyanins of Malus 'Royalty'fruits have a significant inhibitory effect on the gastric cancer cell lineBGC-803. The in vitro cell viability test of CCK-8 showed that the inhibitoryeffect on tumor cells was more significant with the increased anthocyaninconcentration, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 105.5mug/mL. The cell morphology was observed by an inverted microscope, and it wasfound that the backbone of BGC-803 treated with a high concentration ofanthocyanins was disintegrated and the nucleoplasm was concentrated. Themechanism of apoptosis was analyzed by Western blotting, and the results showedthat with increasing anthocyanin concentration in the medium, the expressionlevels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak increased, and the expressionlevels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL decreased, whichcoordinated the regulation of cell apoptosis. This research suggests that theenriched anthocyanin fraction from Malus 'Royalty' fruits have potentialantitumor and adjuvant therapeutic effects on gastric cancer.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134243 [doi]
AB  - Ti3C2Tx MXene has attracted considerable interest as a new emergingtwo-dimensional material for environmental remediation due to its high adsorptioncapacity. However, its use is greatly limited by its poor mechanical properties, low processability and recyclability, and the low dispersity of such powdermaterials. In this work, a porous adsorbent (C-CMP) containing cellulosenanocrystals (CNC), Ti3C2Tx MXene and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was prepared by asimple and environmentally-friendly foaming method. Glutaraldehyde was used ascrosslinker to improve the mechanical properties and boost the adsorptionefficiency of methylene blue (MB) molecules. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), elemental analysis (EDX) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) further confirmedthat the preparation of the C-CMP foam and cross-linking reaction weresuccessful. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the macropores weredistributed homogeneously. The adsorption experiment showed that maximumadsorption capacity of MB can reach 239.92 mg.g(-1) which was much higher thananionic dye (methyl orange, 45.25 mg.g(-1)). The adsorption behavior fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic.Based on FT-IR, EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, theadsorption mechanism between C-CMP and MB molecules was attributed toelectrostatic interaction.

TI  - Amino-Functionalized Titanium Based Metal-Organic Framework for PhotocatalyticHydrogen Production.
LID - 4241 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134241 [doi]
AB  - Photocatalytic hydrogen production using stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), especially the titanium-based MOFs (Ti-MOFs) as photocatalysts is one of the mostpromising solutions to solve the energy crisis. However, due to the highreactivity and harsh synthetic conditions, only a limited number of Ti-MOFs have been reported so far. Herein, we synthesized a new amino-functionalized Ti-MOFs, named NH2-ZSTU-2 (ZSTU stands for Zhejiang Sci-Tech University), forphotocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. TheNH2-ZSTU-2 was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method, composed of2,4,6-tri(4-carboxyphenylphenyl)-aniline (NH2-BTB) triangular linker and infiniteTi-oxo chains. The structure and photoelectrochemical properties of NH2-ZSTU-2were fully studied by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope,nitro sorption isotherms, solid-state diffuse reflectance absorption spectra, andMott-Schottky measurements, etc., which conclude that NH2-ZSTU-2 was favorablefor photocatalytic hydrogen production. Benefitting from those structuralfeatures, NH2-ZSTU-2 showed steady hydrogen production rate under visible lightirradiation with average photocatalytic H2 yields of 431.45 mumol.g(-1).h(-1)with triethanolamine and Pt as sacrificial agent and cocatalyst, respectively,which is almost 2.5 times higher than that of its counterpart ZSTU-2. Thestability and proposed photocatalysis mechanism were also discussed. This workpaves the way to design Ti-MOFs for photocatalysis.

TI  - Hemostasis Disturbances in Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device(CF-LVAD) Patients-Rationale and Study Design.
LID - 3712 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11133712 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices are a treatment option for end-stage heartfailure patients. Despite advancing technologies, bleeding and thromboembolicevents strongly decrease the survival and the quality of life of these patients. Little is known about prognostic factors determining these adverse events in thisgroup of patients. Therefore, we plan to investigate 90 consecutive leftventricular assist device (LVAD) patients and study in vitro fibrin clotproperties (clot lysis time, clot permeability, fibrin ultrastructure using ascanning electron microscope) and the calibrated automated thrombogram inaddition to the von Willebrand factor antigen, fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombintime/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and activated partialthromboplastin time (APTT) to identify prognostic factors of adverse outcomesduring the course of therapy. We plan to assess the hemostasis system at fourdifferent time points, i.e., before LVAD implantation, 3-4 months after LVADimplantation, 6-12 months after LVAD implantation, and at the end of the study(at 5 years or at the time of the adverse event). Adverse outcomes were definedas bleeding events (bleeding in general or in the following subtypes: severebleeding, fatal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding),thromboembolic events (stroke or transient ischemic attack, pump thrombosis,including thrombosis within the pump or its inflow or outflow conduits, arterial peripheral thromboembolism), and death.

TI  - High Definition Three-Dimensional Exoscope (VITOM 3D) in E.N.T. Surgery: ASystematic Review of Current Experience.
LID - 3639 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11133639 [doi]
AB  - Over the last decade, technological growth has developed new devices for moreprecise surgery based on improved maneuverability, minimally invasive approaches,and magnification of the operating field. In this context, the exoscope hasopened a new phase for more accurate and safer microsurgery, improving theperception of the volume of objects and the depth of structures for planning,targeting, and controlling fine movements. The exoscope could be used for middle ear, transcanal, transmastoid, and craniotomy procedures that require two-handed dissection, both to perform both totally VITOM-based techniques and coupled totraditional procedures with an operating microscope or endoscope. In addition,the VITOM 3D system allows the surgeon to work with high-definition images, whichis essential in facial nerve surgery or submandibular salivary stone or tearsurgery approaches, where magnification plays a fundamental role in surgicalsuccess and in reducing operating times. The 3D exoscope approach could also beincluded in traditional transoral procedures for oropharyngeal carcinoma. Theexoscope may provide a relevant approach in teaching surgeons and nurses,allowing adequate training in non-oncological surgical procedures such as atonsillectomy or lateral pharyngoplasty.

TI  - Single-Step Process for Titanium Surface Micro- and Nano-Structuring and In Situ Silver Nanoparticles Formation by Ultra-Short Laser Patterning.
LID - 4670 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134670 [doi]
AB  - Ultra-short laser (USL)-induced surface structuring combined with nanoparticlessynthesis by multiphoton photoreduction represents a novel single-step approachfor commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti) surface enhancement. Such a combinationleads to the formation of distinct topographical features covered bynanoparticles. The USL processing of cp-Ti in an aqueous solution of silvernitrate (AgNO3) induces the formation of micron-sized spikes surmounted by silvernanoparticles (AgNPs). The proposed approach combines the structuring andoxidation of the Ti surface and the synthesis of AgNPs in a one-step process,without the use of additional chemicals or a complex apparatus. Such a process iseasy to implement, versatile and sustainable compared to alternativemethodologies capable of obtaining comparable results. Antimicrobial surfaces on medical devices (e.g., surgical tools or implants), for which titanium is widely used, can be realized due to the simultaneous presence of AgNPs andmicro/nano-structured surface topography. The processed surfaces were examined bymeans of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-rayspectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. Thesurface morphology and the oxidation, quality and quantity of AgNPs were analyzedin relation to process parameters (laser scanning speed and AgNO3 concentration),as well as the effect of AgNPs on the Raman signal of Titanium oxide.

TI  - Evaluation of the Shear Bond Strength of Four Bioceramic Materials with DifferentRestorative Materials and Timings.
LID - 4668 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134668 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of a resin composite (RC) and a resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) to four different bioceramic materials and to compare the effects of the immediate vs. delayedplacement of restoration on the SBS. A total of 160 Teflon blocks and 40blocks/material, were randomly filled with one of the bioceramic materials(NeoPUTTY((R)), NeoMTA2((R)), TotalFill((R)) BC RRM Fast Set Putty, andProRoot((R)) MTA). The restoration was performed immediately or in a delayed timeframe (after 7 days) using a Filtek Z350 XT Flowable composite (bonded to thebioceramic materials using Single bond universal 3M) or GC Fuji II LC((R)) RMGI. The SBS test was performed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, and the failure modewas evaluated under a digital microscope by one blinded examiner. One-wayanalysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Games-Howell post hoc test was used tocompare the mean SBS between the groups. The mean SBS of the bioceramic materialsto RC was significantly higher than to RMGI except for ProRoot MTA (p-value0.65). The SBS values to RC were as follows: ProRoot MTA (7.64 MPa); NeoMTA2(8.57 MPa) which was significantly higher than both NeoPUTTY (4.04 MPa) andTotalFill((R)) BC RRM Fast Set Putty (4.38 MPa). For RMGI groups, ProRoot MTAshowed the highest SBS (7.18 MPa), followed by NeoMTA2 (4.15 MPa), NeoPUTTY (1.62MPa), and TotalFill((R)) BC RRM Fast Set Putty (1.54 MPa). The delayed timingrestoration showed a significantly higher SBS than the immediate, except for the immediate RMGI restoration with MTA. To conclude, the SBS of RC to the bioceramicmaterials was significantly higher than RMGI, except for ProRoot MTA. Bothrestorative materials had a significantly higher SBS to the MTA groups incomparison to premixed bioceramics. Delayed RC restoration had a higher SBS than immediate restoration. Similarly, delayed RMGI restoration had a higher SBS than immediate restoration with premixed bioceramic but not with MTA.

TI  - Assessment of Pozzolanic Activity of Ground Scoria Rocks under Low- andHigh-Pressure (Autoclave) Steam Curing.
LID - 4666 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134666 [doi]
AB  - Two sources of natural scoria rocks were procured and ground for use in concrete as natural pozzolans (NP1 and NP2). The evaluation of their pozzolanic reactivityis carried out using different techniques and approaches. The primary goal ofemploying these techniques is to monitor the amount of portlandite (CH=Ca(OH)2)consumed during steam curing at low or high pressure. The pozzolanicity of NPpowders is determined either directly by monitoring CH variation or indirectly bycompressive strength and microstructure development. Autoclave curing is known tostimulate the pozzolanicity of the inert siliceous and aluminosiliceous materialsunder its high-pressure steam conditions. Both steam-curing conditions wereapplied in this investigation. In this study, X-ray diffraction, scanningelectron microscope, thermogravimetric, Fourier transform infrared, andisothermal analyzers were used. It is concluded that the nature and types ofminerals in SR determine their pozzolanic reactivity as either low-pressuresteam-reactive or high-pressure steam-reactive cementitious materials. Due to thenature of their silicate structures, notably single-chain or 3D-frameworkstructures, plagioclase feldspars (albite-anorthite) minerals are high-pressuresteam-reactive minerals, whereas pyroxene (enstatite and diopside) minerals arelow-pressure steam-reactive minerals. Using high-pressure steam curing, variedreplacement levels of up to 60% were achieved in NP1, with a consistent strength activity index (SAI) of 99%, while an SAI of 79% was obtained with NP2. Duringlow-pressure steam curing, NP1 and NP2 consumed around 72 and 80% of portlandite,respectively, demonstrating their relative pozzolanic reactivity. When comparedto the control concrete mix, the strength activity indices of NP1, NP2, and classF fly ash in their normal concrete mixes reached 74.3, 82, and 73.7%,respectively, after 56 days of normal curing conditions.

TI  - Single Dense Layer of PEO Coating on Aluminum Fabricated by "Chain-like"Discharges.
LID - 4635 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134635 [doi]
AB  - Reducing the loose-layer-to-dense-layer ratio in PEO coatings on aluminum and itsalloys is the key to improving their corrosion resistance and expanding theirapplications in the aerospace industry and other fields. In this paper, wedescribe the discharge evolution during the PEO process in exhaustive detail and report the appearance of a novel "chain-like" discharge for the first time. Weinvestigated the microstructure and composition of PEO coatings using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS)and an X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The results reflected that the coatingcomposition changed from amorphous Al2O3 to crystalline gamma-Al2O3 andalpha-Al2O3 phases with the evolution of the plasma spark discharge state. Weevaluated the electrochemical behavior of the coatings using a potentiodynamicpolarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3.5 wt.%NaCl solution. Under "chain-like" discharge, the icorr of the coating on Al was8.564 x 10(-9) Acm(-2), which was five orders of magnitude lower than that of thesample without the PEO coating. Moreover, we evaluated the adhesion strength ofthe coatings at different stages using a pull-off test. The adhesion strength of the PEO coatings at stage V reached 70 MPa. Furthermore, the high content ofalpha-Al2O3 increased the hardness of the coating to 2000 HV. Therefore, the"chain-like" discharge promoted the formation of a single dense layer with 2.8%porosity and that demonstrated excellent properties. We also propose a mechanism to explain the influence of the plasma spark discharge state on themicrostructure and composition of the PEO coatings.

TI  - Fluorinated Agents Effects on Orthodontic Alloys: A Descriptive In Vitro Study.
LID - 4612 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134612 [doi]
AB  - Fluoride-based mouthwashes and gels are preventive measures in counteringdemineralization and caries but, modifying environmental acidity, can reduce the wet corrosion resistance of orthodontic alloys. To evaluate chemical stability,in vitro experiments were conducted on stainless steel and nickel-titanium wires,weighed before and after immersion in household fluorinated mouthwashes and gels,measuring weight variations and elution of metal ions from acid corrosionphenomena. Elution samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma massspectrometry, detecting residual ion concentration, while surface changes wereanalyzed under scanning electron microscopy. Results showed stainless steel wiresdo not undergo significant erosion when exposed to most fluorinated mouthwashesbut, at prolonged exposure, alloys elute gradually greater amounts of metals and Ni-Ti wires become more sensitive to some mouthwashes. Ions' elution variesconsiderably, especially for Ni-Ti wires, if exposed to household fluorinatedgels, for which significant negative values were obtained. Changes, affectingwires' outer layer, negatively act on shiny appearance and luster, reducingcorrosion resistance. Although examined orthodontic wires showed good chemicalstability and low toxicity, surface corrosion from exposure to fluorinated agentswas observed. Home use must be accompanied by clinician prescription and, forhousehold dental gels, must follow manufacturers' recommendations, ensuringprophylactic action without damaging alloys surfaces.

TI  - Stress Component Decoupling Analysis Based on Large Numerical Aperture Objective Lens, an Impractical Approach.
LID - 4616 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134616 [doi]
AB  - Micro Raman spectroscopy is an effective method to quantitatively analyse theinternal stress of semiconductor materials and structures. However, thedecoupling analysis of the stress components for {100} monocrystalline silicon(c-Si) remains difficult. In the work outlined, physical and simulationexperiments were combined to study the influence of the objective lens numerical aperture (NA) on the Raman stress characterization. The physical experiments and simulation experiments show that the spectral results obtained by using lenseswith different NAs can accurately obtain the principal stress sum but cannotdecouple the components of the in-plane stress. Even if the spectral resolutionof the simulated experiment is ideal (The random errors of the polarizationdirections of less than +/-1 degrees and the systematic random errors of lessthan +/-0.02 cm(-1)). The analysis based on the theoretical model demonstratesthat the proportion of the principal stress sum in the Raman shift obtained in anactual experiment exceeded 98.7%, while the proportion of the principal stressdifference part was almost negligible. This result made it difficult to identify the variable effects of different stress states from the experimental results.Further simulation experiments in this work verify that when the principal stresssum was identical, the differences in the Raman shifts caused by different stressstates were much smaller than the resolution of the existing Raman microscopesystem, which was hardly possible to identify in the experimental results. It wasproven that decoupling analysis of stress components using the large-NA objectivelens lacked actual practicability.

AB  - La2/3Cu3Ti4O12 ceramics were prepared by the same method of solid-state reaction as CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics. The structure and dielectric responses forLa2/3Cu3Ti4O12 and CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics were systematically investigated by X-raydiffraction, scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and impedance analyzer. Compared with CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramics, La2/3Cu3Ti4O12 ceramicswith higher density and refined grain exhibit a high dielectric constant(epsilon' ~ 10(4)) and two dielectric relaxations in a wide temperature range.The dielectric relaxation below 200 K with an activation energy of 0.087 eV inLa2/3Cu3Ti4O12 ceramics is due to the polyvalent state of Ti(3+)/Ti(4+) andCu(+)/Cu(2+), while the dielectric relaxation above 450 K with higher activation energy (0.596 eV) is due to grain boundary effects. These thermal activateddielectric relaxations with lower activation energy in La2/3Cu3Ti4O12 ceramicsboth move to lower temperatures, which can be associated with the enhancedpolyvalent structure in La2/3Cu3Ti4O12 ceramics. Such high dielectric constantceramics are also expected to be applied in capacitors and memory devices.

TI  - The Microstructural Evolution of Cu-Sn-P Alloy during Hot Deformation Process.
LID - 4501 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134501 [doi]
AB  - The microstructure evolution of Cu-Sn-P alloy subjected to hot deformation wasresearched through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmissionelectron microscope (TEM) in the present study. The results indicated that after hot deformation, grains perpendicular to the force direction were elongated, and mostly became deformed grains, and then exhibited an obvious hardening effect.The Cu-Sn-P alloy could be strain hardened during hot deformation, but, withrecrystallization, a softening effect occurred. Changes in dislocation density,textures, and grain sizes play different roles in flow stress behaviors ofCu-Sn-P alloy, and the dislocation density has a more evident effect at lowtemperature. However, with increase in temperature, recrystallization softeninggradually dominates. Low-angle grain boundaries (LABs) account for the majorityof hot deformed microstructures of Cu-Sn-P alloy. High dislocation densities inthese zones make it easy to initiate the dislocation slipping systems.Deformation is realized through dislocation slipping and the slipping of edgedislocation pairs. The dislocation pile-up zones have high distortion energies,and, thus, elements of diffusion and recrystallization nucleation can occureasily. At different temperatures, the maximum polar density of texturesgradually increases, and there are preferred orientations of grains. At 500degrees C, stacking faults accumulate and promote the growth of twins. The twingrowth direction is mainly determined by the migration of high-angle grainboundaries (HABs) and the clustering of high-stress zones.

TI  - Effect of Nb Addition and Heat Input on Heat-Affected Zone Softening inHigh-Strength Low-Alloy Steel.

LID - 10.3390/ma15134503 [doi]
AB  - The effect of both Nb content and heat input on the softening phenomenon of theheat-affected zone (HAZ) of low-alloy high-strength steel was studied throughwelding thermal simulation experiments. The microstructure evolution, densityvariation of geometrically necessary dislocation, microhardness distribution and the second phase precipitation behavior in HAZ was characterized and analyzed by combining the optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, high-resolutiontransmission electron microscope with microhardness tests. The results showedthat the softening appeared in the fine-grain HAZ (FGHAZ) of the low-alloyhigh-strength steel with the polygonal ferrite and bainite microstructure. Withan increase in Nb content, the FGHAZ softening was inhibited even with high heat input; however, the hardness shows little variation. On the one hand, theincrease in the Nb content increased the volume fraction of high-strength bainitein the FGHAZ. On the other hand, the remarkable strengthening was produced by theequally distributed precipitation nanoparticles. As a result, the two factorswere the main reason for the solution of the FGHAZ softening problem in thelow-alloyed high-strength steel with the mixed microstructure of ferrite andbainite.

LID - 4494 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134494 [doi]
AB  - The phase structure and microstructure of Sm12Co88-xCux (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10;at.%) as-cast alloys and melt-spun ribbons prepared via the arc-melting methodand melt-spun technology were studied experimentally by X-ray diffraction (XRD)and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).The results reveal that the Sm12Co88-xCux (x = 0) as-cast alloy contains Sm2Co17 and Sm5Co19 phases, while the Sm12Co88-xCux (x = 2) as-cast alloy is composed of Sm2Co17, Sm2Co7 and Sm(Co, Cu)5 phases. Sm2Co17 and Sm(Co, Cu)5 phases aredetected in Sm12Co88-xCux (x = 4, 6, 8, 10) as-cast alloys. Meanwhile,Sm12Co88-xCux ribbons show a single SmCo7 phase, which is still formed in theribbons annealed at 1023 K for one hour. After annealed at 1123 K for two hours, cooled slowly down to 673 K at 0.5 K/min and then kept for four hours, theribbons are composed of Sm2Co17 and Sm(Co, Cu)5 phases. The magnetic measurementsof Sm12Co88-xCux ribbons were performed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).The results exhibit that the maximum magnetic energy product ((BH)max), thecoercivity (Hcj) and the remanence (Br) of the Sm12Co88-xCux ribbons increasegenerally with the increase in Cu substitution. In particular, the magneticproperties of the ribbons annealed at 1123 K and 673 K increase significantlywith the increase in Cu substitution, resulting from the increase in the volumefraction of the formed Sm(Co, Cu)5 phase after heat treatment.

TI  - Concrete Durability after Load Damage and Salt Freeze-Thaw Cycles.
LID - 4380 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134380 [doi]
AB  - To determine how the performance of concrete changes after initial load damageand salt freezing, concrete samples were first subjected to loading andunloading, and were then put into salt solutions to carry out rapid freeze-thawcycle (FTC) experiments. Salt solutions were created based on the saline soil of western Jilin, China, for use in salt freeze-thaw testing. This determined thechange law of the compressive strength and the dynamic elastic modulus (DEM).Additionally, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance technology and a scanningelectron microscope were applied to investigate the pore characteristics andmicrostructure of concrete samples after FTCs. This study found that when theconcrete specimens were subjected to an initial load of 0.3f under 50 FTCs, theloss in the compressive strength increased by 24% when the concrete was subjectedto freeze-thaw cycles in freshwater and increased by 24% when concrete wassubjected to freeze-thaw cycles in a 6.8% composite salt solution compared withthe specimens without the initial load. When the concrete was subjected to FTCsin a 6.8% composite salt solution 50 times, the loss in the compressive strength increased by 110% for concrete without an initial load and increased by 109% whenthe concrete was subjected to an initial load of 0.3f compared with the specimensunder FTCs in freshwater. The persistent effect of the FTCs also aggravatedchloride ion erosion in the concrete, which gradually reduced the concrete'spermeability resistance. Internal pores in the concrete, especially theproportion of above-medium-sized pores, gradually increased along with theincrease in the number of FTCs. There is a good linear correlation between thechange rule of compressive mechanical properties and the change rules of mass,DEM, and pore characteristics inside the concrete under rapid FTCs in differentsalt solutions.

TI  - Effects of Storage Temperature on Indica-Japonica Hybrid Rice Metabolites,Analyzed Using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry.
LID - 7421 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137421 [doi]
AB  - The Yongyou series of indica-japonica hybrid rice has excellent productionpotential and storage performance. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of its storage resistance. In this study, Yongyou 1540 rice (Oryzasativa cv. yongyou 1540) was stored at different temperatures, and thestorability was validated though measuring nutritional components and apparentchange. In addition, a broad-targeted metabolomic approach coupled with liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry was applied to analyze the metabolite changes.The study found that under high temperature storage conditions (35 degrees C),Yongyou 1540 was not significantly worse in terms of fatty acid value, whiteness value, and changes in electron microscope profile. A total of 19 key differentialmetabolites were screened, and lipid metabolites related to palmitoleic acid werefound to affect the aging of rice. At the same time, two substances, guanosine3',5'-cyclophosphate and pipecolic acid, were beneficial to enhance theresistance of rice under harsh storage conditions, thereby delaying thedeterioration of its quality and maintaining its quality. Significant regulation of galactose metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, butyratemetabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism pathways were probablyresponsible for the good storage capacity of Yongyou 1540.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23137407 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the change in clindamycin phosphateantibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria using the platelet-richfibrin as a carrier matrix, and evaluate the changes in the antibiotic within thematrix. The antibacterial properties of CLP and its combination with PRF weretested in a microdilution test against reference cultures and clinical isolatesof Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.epidermidis). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanningelectron microscope (SEM) analysis was done to evaluate the changes in thePRF_CLP matrix. Release kinetics of CLP was defined with ultra-performance liquidchromatography (UPLC). According to FTIR data, the use of PRF as a carrier forCLP ensured the structural changes in the CLP toward a more active form ofclindamycin. A significant decrease in minimal bactericidal concentration values (from 1000 microg/mL to 62 microg/mL) against reference cultures and clinicalisolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was observed for the CLP and PRF samplesif compared to pure CLP solution. In vitro cell viability tests showed that PRFand PRF with CLP have higher cell viability than 70% after 24 h and 48 h timepoints. This article indicates that CLP in combination with PRF showed higherantibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis compared to pure CLP solution. This modified PRF could be used as a novel method to increase drugdelivery and efficacy, and to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.

AB  - Connexin (Cx) hemichannels (HCs) are large pore hexameric structures that allowthe exchange of ions, metabolites and a variety of other molecules between thecell cytoplasm and extracellular milieu. HC inhibitors are attracting growinginterest as drug candidates because deregulated fluxes through HCs have beenimplicated in a plethora of genetic conditions and other diseases. HC activityhas been mainly investigated by electrophysiological methods and/or usingHC-permeable dye uptake measurements. Here, we present an all-optical assay basedon fluorometric measurements of ionized calcium (Ca(2+)) uptake with aCa(2+)-selective genetically encoded indicator (GCaMP6s) that permits the opticaltracking of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt) changes with highsensitivity. We exemplify use of the assay in stable pools of HaCaT cellsoverexpressing human Cx26, Cx46, or the pathological mutant Cx26G45E, undercontrol of a tetracycline (Tet) responsive element (TRE) promoter (Tet-on). Wedemonstrate the usefulness of the assay for the characterization of newmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the extracellular domain of the HCs.Although we developed the assay on a spinning disk confocal fluorescencemicroscope, the same methodology can be extended seamlessly to high-throughputhigh-content platforms to screen other kinds of inhibitors and/or to probe HCsexpressed in primary cells and microtissues.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma is a prevalent disease associated with high morbidity andmortality rates. Partial nephrectomy is a first-line surgical option because itallows the preservation of renal function. Clear differentiation between normaland cancerous tissues is critical for increasing the negative margin rates. This study investigated the capability of the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging agent ASP5354 for in vivo fluorescence imaging of renal cell carcinoma. ASP5354at a single dose of 12 nmol (0.037 mg)/kg body weight was intravenouslyadministered to healthy and orthotopic renal cell carcinoma mice underanesthesia. NIR images of the abdominal cavity were obtained using anear-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) camera system. In addition, the cancerouskidneys were harvested, and the NIRF in their sections was measured using an NIRFmicroscope. Normal renal tissue emitted strong NIRF but the cancer tissue didnot. The difference in NIRF intensity between the normal and cancer tissuesclearly presented the boundary between the normal and cancer tissues in macro andmicro NIRF imaging. ASP5354 can distinguish cancer tissue from normal tissueusing NIRF. Thus, ASP5354 is a promising agent for renal cell carcinoma tissueimaging in partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma patients.

AB  - Innovative non-antibiotic compounds such as graphene oxide (GO) andlight-emitting diodes (LEDs) may represent a valid strategy for managing chronic wound infections related to resistant pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate 630nm LED and 880 nm LED ability to enhance the GO antimicrobial activity againstStaphylococcus aureus- and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-resistant strains in adual-species biofilm in the Lubbock chronic wound biofilm (LCWB) model. Theeffect of a 630 nm LED, alone or plus 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALAD)-mediatedphotodynamic therapy (PDT) (ALAD-PDT), or an 880 nm LED on the GO (50 mg/l)action was evaluated by determining the CFU/mg reductions, live/dead analysis,scanning electron microscope observation, and reactive oxygen species assay.Among the LCWBs, the best effect was obtained with GO irradiated with ALAD-PDT,with percentages of CFU/mg reduction up to 78.96% +/- 0.21 and 95.17% +/- 2.56for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The microscope images showed areduction in the cell number and viability when treated with GO + ALAD-PDT. Inaddition, increased ROS production was detected. No differences were recordedwhen GO was irradiated with an 880 nm LED versus GO alone. The obtained resultssuggest that treatment with GO irradiated with ALAD-PDT represents a valid,sustainable strategy to counteract the polymicrobial colonization of chronicwounds.

TI  - Circadian Volume Changes in Hippocampal Glia Studied by Label-FreeInterferometric Imaging.
LID - 2073 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11132073 [doi]
AB  - Complex brain functions, including learning and memory, arise in part from themodulatory role of astrocytes on neuronal circuits. Functionally, the dentategyrus (DG) exhibits differences in the acquisition of long-term potentiation(LTP) between day and night. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of astrocyte morphology plays an important role in the functional circuitry of hippocampallearning and memory, specifically in the DG. Standard microscopy techniques, suchas differential interference contrast (DIC), present insufficient contrast fordetecting changes in astrocyte structure and function and are unable to inform onthe intrinsic structure of the sample in a quantitative manner. Recently,gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) has been developed to upgrade a DICmicroscope with quantitative capabilities such as single-cell dry mass and volumecharacterization. Here, we present a methodology for combining GLIM andelectrophysiology to quantify the astrocyte morphological behavior over theday-night cycle. Colocalized measurements of GLIM and fluorescence allowed us to quantify the dry masses and volumes of hundreds of astrocytes. Our resultsindicate that, on average, there is a 25% cell volume reduction during thenocturnal cycle. Remarkably, this cell volume change takes place at constant dry mass, which suggests that the volume regulation occurs primarily through aqueous medium exchange with the environment.

TI  - Study on Antidepressant Effect and Mechanism of Crocin Mediated by the mTORSignaling Pathway.
LID - 10.1007/s11064-022-03668-z [doi]
AB  - Crocin is a monomer of Chinese traditional herbs extracted from saffron,relieving depression-like behavior. However, its underlying mechanism of actionremains unclear. Herein, we explored whether crocin's antidepressant effectdepended on the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Themodel of PC12 cells injury was established by corticosterone, the changes in cellsurvival rate were tested by the CCK-8 method, and the changes in cellularmorphology were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The depression modelwas established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and itsantidepressant effect was estimated by open field test (OFT), forced swimmingtest (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). Western blot was used to monitor the protein expression. The results showed that crocin could effectively improve cellsurvival rate and cellular synaptic growth, alleviate the depressive behavior of CUMS mice, and promote the expression of BDNF, P-mTOR, P-ERK, and PSD95. However,when rapamycin was pretreated, the antidepressant effects of crocin wereinhibited. In summary, crocin plays a significant antidepressant effect. Afterpretreatment with rapamycin, the anti-depression effect of crocin wassignificantly inhibited. It is suggested that the mechanism of theanti-depression effect of crocin may be related to the mTOR signaling pathway.

Therefore, the removalof food colorants must be made in accordance with the necessity of healthawareness in life. Photocatalyst treatment using semiconductors shows a promisingway to solve these issues. In this relation, this paper presents the novelnanoflower shaped NiO/CuO (0.9:0.1 M and 0.5:0.5 M) photocatalysts developed via co-precipitation method for the destruction of methyl orange (MO) as a model foodcolorant under visible light irradiation. The X-ray diffraction result proposedthat the composite catalysts consist of mixed heterostructures (cubic andmonoclinic) with no other impurities. From the images of transmission electronmicroscope, the catalyst presents nano spherical and cubical mixed morphologies. Besides, NiO/CuO (0.5:0.5 M) catalyst exhibits agglomeration due to the highlycontented CuO. The Energy Dispersive X-ray spectra gave the elementalconfiguration without other impurity traces. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surfacearea of NiO/CuO (0.9:0.1 M) catalyst occupies higher surface area. Unfortunately,NiO/CuO (0.5:0.5 M) sample has lower surface area due to the agglomeratedparticles. The UV-vis spectra confirmed that the absorption of the catalyst lies in higher wavelength region occupying small band gap. Moreover, the visible lightactivity of the catalysts showed 75.3% (0.9:0.1 M) and 40.2% (0.5:0.5 M)degrading efficiencies. At the end, the highly efficient catalyst was experiencedphotocatalytic activity upto 5 repeated runs and the efficiency remained thesame. Therefore, the catalyst NiO/CuO (0.9:0.1 M) has prompted the successfuldegradation of MO food colorant under visible light.

AB  - Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides a technical platform for nanoscopicmapping of biological structures. Correct preparation of SEM samples can provide an unprecedented understanding of the nexus between cellular morphology andtopography. This comparative study critically examines two coating methods forpreparing biological samples for scanning electron microscopy, while alsoproviding novel advice on how to prepare in vitro epithelial or endothelialsamples for high-resolution scanning-electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Two obstacles often confront the biologist when investigating cellular structures grown undertissue culture conditions, namely., how to prepare and present the biologicalsamples to the HR-SEM microscope without affecting topographical membrane andcellular structural alterations. Firstly, our use of the Millicell celluloseinserts on which to grow our cellular samples in preparation for HR-SEM is bothnovel and advantageous to comparing the permeability function of cells to theirmorphological function. Secondly, biological material is often non-conducting,thermally sensitive and fragile and, therefore, needs to be fixed correctly andcoated with thin conducting metal to ensure high-resolution detail of samples.Immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd5) was used as a basis fordescribing the preferences in the use of the protocol. We compare two biological sample coating modalities for the visualizing and analysis of texturized,topographical, membranous ultrastructures of brain endothelial cell (BEC)confluent monolayers, namely, carbon and gold:palladium (Au:Pd) sputter coatingin preparation for HR-SEM. BEC monolayers sputter-coated with these twomodalities produced three-dimensional micrographs which have distinctly differenttopographical detail from which the nanostructural cellular data can be examined.The two coating methods display differences in the amount of nanoscopic detailthat could be resolved in the nanosized membrane cytoarchitecture of BECmonolayers. The micrographical data clearly showed that Au:Pd sputter-coatedsamples generate descript imagery, providing useful information for profilingmembrane nanostructures compared to carbon-coated samples. The recommendationsregarding the contrast in two modalities would provide the necessary guidance to biological microscopists in preparing tissue culture samples for HR-SEM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. is recognized as an opportunistic zoonoticparasite that infects humans as well as wild and domestic animals. This entericprotozoan is a major cause of diarrhea in humans and animals and often result in death due to severe dehydration. The present study was designed to investigatethe prevalence, identification of various risk factors and evaluation ofsensitivity of the two diagnostic techniques for rapid and correct detection ofCryptosporidium infection in diarrheic sheep in Pakistan. METHODS: A total of 360fecal samples were collected and processed for detection of Cryptosporidiuminfection after proper preservation. These samples were properly stained withmodified Ziehl-Neelsen acid staining and then examined under simple microscope at100x magnification for confirmation of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The same samples were again processed through simple PCR for confirmation of the Cryptosporidiumspp. RESULTS: The age wise prevalence was detected through simple microscopy and PCR. We found highest prevalence at the age of </=1 year followed by 1-2 years ofage while the lowest prevalence was recorded at the age of >/= 2-3 years of sheepand found significant difference between different ages (P<0.05). The sex wiseprevalence showed the highest prevalence in male (male symbol) animals detectedcompared to female (female symbol). The overall prevalence was detected 27.08%and 18.80% through PCR and simple microscopy, respectively, and significantdifference between two diagnostic techniques were observed (P<0.05). Considering the seasonality, the highest prevalence was recorded through simple microscopy inautumn, summer, and spring, while the lowest in winter. These results wereconfirmed through PCR. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that molecular detection isthe most efficient, specific and sensitive technique for detection ofCryptosporidium infection than simple microscopy. Moreover sheep is the majorpotential source of infection to other wild and domestic animals includinghumans.

LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-22-0607-RE [doi]
AB  - Environmental temperature and humidity play a vital role in plant-pathogeninteractions, which profoundly affect the occurrence of crop diseases. However,the specific methods and mechanisms through which intermittent changes intemperature and humidity mitigate plant diseases remain unclear. In this study,six temperature and humidity combinations were set, the disease severity oftomatoes, biomass of Botrytis cinerea were analyzed, and the infection process ofpathogens was observed using an optical microscope. Furthermore, dual RNA-seqanalysis was performed to explore the interactions between plants and pathogens. Results showed that the 24hpi-12h day (regulation was performed at 24hpi (hourspost-inoculation) for 12h after inoculation during the day) treatment reduced thegray mold severity and biomass of B. cinerea in plants by the greatest amount andeffectively inhibited the growth of mycelia. The 24hpi-12h day treatment induced the up-regulation of light reactions, photorespiration, and Calvin cycle-related genes in tomatoes, whereas fungal genes related to the biosynthesis ofsesquiterpene botrydial and polyketide botcinic acid were downregulated. Overall,we identified the optimal combination of temperature and humidity changes toinhibit the development of tomato gray mold, and preliminarily explored theinteractions between tomato and B. cinerea under temperature and humiditychanges. This work has practical importance and provides a theoretical basis for the ecological control of plant diseases.

TI  - 3D shape reconstruction of normal and cancerous red blood cells using digitalholographic tomography: Combination of angular spectrum method and multiplicativetechnique.
LID - 10.1111/jmi.13133 [doi]
AB  - Since the red blood cell shape affects the oxygen transport, so a robust methodto reconstruct the 3D shape of an RBC from different projections is presented. A robust one-piece polarizing holographic microscope setup is used to record inlineholograms of normal and cancerous red blood cells (RBCs) with high stability. Theinline holograms are corrected by flat fielding and windowed Fourier filteringmethods to mitigate the zero-order and the defocused twin image due to the inlinerecording configuration to the least measure. The corrected inline holograms are then reconstructed by the angular spectrum method to extract the 2D wrappingphase-contrast images. The 2D wrapping phase-contrast images are then unwrappedusing the graph cuts algorithm to extract the continuous 2D phase-contrastimages. The continuous 2D phase-contrast images are reconstructed at differentprojections by the multiplicative technique to extract the 3D shape of the normaland the cancerous RBCs. Experimental results show that any deformation in theshape of the normal and the cancerous RBCs can be seen clearly at any rotational angle in 3D. This method, which is based on the degree of deformation from thebest fitting, can be used as an alternative method of counting method fordiscrimination between normal and cancerous cells and hence diagnoses the diseaseeasily.

PG  - 104637
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104637 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate the successful implementation of a terahertz (THz) quantum-wellphotodetector (QWP) for effective signal collection in a scattering-type scanningnear-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) system. The light source is anelectrically pumped THz quantum cascade laser (QCL) at 4.2 THz, which spectrally matches with the peak photoresponse of THz QWP. The sensitive THz QWP has a lownoise equivalent power (NEP) of about 1.1 pW/Hz(0.5) and a spectral responserange from 2 to 7 THz. The fast-responding capability of the THz QWP is vital fordetecting the rapidly tip-modulated THz light which can effectively suppress the background noise. The THz images of the nanostructure demonstrate a spatialresolution of about 95 nm, corresponding to approximately lambda/752 at 4.2 THz. We experimentally investigate and theoretically interpret the formation of thefringes which appear at the edge position of a gold stripe in the THz near-field image.

AB  - Introduction and Objective: The proper performance of a sealer in root canaltreatment depends on its physical properties. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the effect of two bioceramic and epoxy resin sealers in terms ofmarginal adaptation and tubular penetration depth in different obturation methodsof human premolar teeth. Materials and Methods: A total of 82 premolar teethextracted due to caries and gum disease were used in the present in vitroexperimental study. Two types of sealers, epoxy resin (AH-Plus, Dentsply,Germany) and bioceramic (Endosequence BC sealer, Brasseler, Savannah, GA, USA),were used in this research. Lateral compaction and single-cone techniques wereused for filling the teeth. Marginal adaptation and tubular penetration depthwere measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanningmicroscope (CLSM), respectively. Statistical analysis of data was performed byrepeated-measures ANOVA. The significance level was considered as P < 0.05.Results: The marginal adaptation and tubular penetration depth in all threecoronal, middle, and apical regions were better in bioceramic sealer (P < 0.001).The marginal adaptation and tubular penetration depth in all regions were notaffected by the filling method and the interaction between the sealer type andthe obturation technique. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, the useof bioceramic sealer caused better depth of tubular penetration and marginaladaptation compared to epoxy resin. Further studies and the use of differentfilling techniques are necessary to achieve a three-dimensional sealing in curvedroot canals.

AB  - In order to study the application value of CT three-dimensional microscopereconstruction technology in the diagnosis of cervical cancer. In this paper, 232patients with newly diagnosed stage IA-II A2 and some stage III C: cervicalcancer (stage IB1-IIA2 of stage f go in 2009) were selected, and 204 patientswith stage IB1-IIA2 of stage 2009 fig 0 were selected. The original data of DICOMwere obtained by CT scanning and imported into mics10.01 software to completelymph node reconstruction. The short diameter value > 10 mm is used as thestandard to judge whether the lymph node is metastatic. Referring to the 2018fig 0 staging standard, if it indicates that the lymph node is positive, it is IIICr stage. The gold standard is the diagnosis of III CP according to the surgical andpathological results, and then the diagnostic efficiency of III C stage isevaluated. The experimental results showed that 65 cases were diagnosed as IIICstage, and 70 cases were diagnosed as IIICp stage. There was consistency between IIICr and IIICp stage, and the kappa value was 0.340. Using CT multiphaseenhanced scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction technology to diagnosecervical cancer has high detection rate and high accuracy of staging diagnosis,which is worthy of clinical application.

AB  - Currently, there are a lot of discussions on the production of sustainable cementfor construction purposes, unlike the conventional ordinary Portland cement(OPC), as its production, transportation, and application contribute to thegeneration of greenhouse gases, hence, climate change. Consequently, limestone,the primary material used to produce OPC, is non-renewable. Therefore, there is aneed to use sustainable materials to make cementitious materials to achievesustainable construction. This has led to a lot of research focussing on thevalorisation of agricultural wastes and less economical, no-food lignocellulosic plants in producing sustainable and environmentally friendly cementitiousmaterials commonly known as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). Theagrowastes ashes include rice husk ash (RHA), sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA), andcorn cob ash (CCA), among others. In contrast, the lignocellulosic plants' ashes include common water reed ash (CWRA) and cyperus papyrus ash (CPA). There hasbeen the belief that these pozzolanic materials are homogenous. However, theseashes are highly heterogeneous when they undergo microscopic analysis. Therefore,the current data paper provides Laser Diffraction Spectroscopy (LD) for Particle Size Distribution (PSD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-RayFluorescence (XRF), and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) data for unprocessedCWRA and CPA in the form of tables, micrographs, and figures for microscopicanalysis. This data helps characterise and evaluate CWRA and CPA's potential aspozzolanic materials, especially as road construction materials, and will bebeneficial for other scientists to better understand unprocessed CWRA and CPAmineral information development biologically inspired materials for biologically inspired materials sustainable development across many disciplines.

TI  - Oridonin attenuates low shear stress-induced endothelial cell dysfunction andoxidative stress by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2pathway.
PG  - 180

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) is the primary cause of cardiovascular diseaseand the incidence is extremely common; however, there are currently few drugsthat can effectively treat AS. Although oridonin has been widely used to treatinflammation and cancer for numerous years, to the best of our knowledge, itsprotective effect against AS has not been reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether oridonin attenuated AS. METHODS: By using textmining, chemometric and chemogenomic methods, oridonin was predicted to be abeneficial agent for the treatment of AS. A parallel flow chamber was used toestablish a low shear stress (LSS)-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunctionmodel. Briefly, ECs were exposed to 3 dyn/cm(2) LSS for 30 min and subsequentlytreated with oridonin or transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA)targeting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione(GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in EA.hy926 cells were analyzed todetermine the level of oxidative stress. The nitric oxide (NO) levels and mRNAexpression levels of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1) andprostaglandin synthase (PGIS) in EA.hy926 cells were analyzed to determine ECdysfunction. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NRF2 wereanalyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot. Inaddition, zebrafish were fed with a high-cholesterol diet to establish azebrafish AS model, which was used to observe lipid accumulation and inflammationunder a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: We found LSS led to oxidative stressand EC dysfunction; this was primarily indicated through the significantlydecreased SOD and GSH content, the significantly increased MDA, GSSG and ROScontent, the upregulated mRNA expression levels of ET-1, and the downregulated NOlevels and mRNA expression levels of eNOS and PGIS in ECs. Notably, oridonincould improve LSS-induced oxidative stress and EC dysfunction, and the effects oforidonin were reversed by the transfection with NRF2 siRNA. Oridonin alsoattenuated lipid accumulation and neutrophil recruitment at the LSS regions inthe zebrafish AS model. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of the presentstudy suggested that oridonin may ameliorate LSS-induced EC dysfunction andoxidative stress by activating NRF2, thereby attenuating AS.

AB  - In current work, a TB-EDA demulsifier for disposing oily wastewater was prepared using thorn fir bark (TB) as starting materials via a hydrothermal andsolvent-free amination route. Field emission scanning electron microscope(FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), and Fourier transforminfrared spectroscope (FT-IR) were employed to characterize the TB-EDAdemulsifier. Three-phase contact angle (CA), interfacial activity, formation ofinterfacial film (FIF), coalescence time of droplets (CTD), dynamic interfacialtension (IFT), and Zeta potential were carried out to study the possibledemulsification mechanism. Bottle test was performed to investigate the effect ofthe TB-EDA dosage, salinity, and pH value on the demulsification performance atroom temperature. Light transmittance (DL) and oil removal rate (DR) of separatedwater were 94.7% and 97.2%, respectively, with 100 mg/L of TB-EDA demulsifier in oily wastewater at room temperature. In addition, the TB-EDA demulsifier has anexcellent salt tolerance even at the salinity of 50,000 mg/L. The correspondingDL and DR could reach 99.8% and 99.9%, respectively.

TI  - Impact of brushing with charcoal on tooth color and enamel loss: An in vitrostudy.
PG  - 133-136
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the whitening efficacy of charcoal powder compared to awhitening toothpaste and the surface loss using scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). METHODS: 60 human extracted teeth were randomly assigned to two groups: Treatment (T, charcoal group: PremiumNature) and Control (C, whitening toothpaste group: Colgate Optic White). Teethin the treatment group were brushed with a charcoal paste. Teeth shade wasevaluated before and after the intervention. Lightness was assessed using bothVITA classical shade guide and VITA Easyshade V. Changes within and between thegroup were evaluated by the paired-sample t-test and independent sample t-test.Surface roughness (Ra) of samples was performed using SEM, and to assess surface loss a CLSM was used. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differencesin teeth lightness, chroma, or hue between both the charcoal and the whiteningtoothpaste groups (P> 0.05). After 21 days of brushing, teeth brushed with thewhitening toothpaste were significantly lighter (VITA Easyshade mean score:78.34, SD: 8.397; VITA classical A1-D4 shade mean: 8.90, SD: 4.475) than thecharcoal group (VITA Easyshade mean: 69.70, SD: 6.364; VITA classical A1-D4 shademean: 11.77; SD: 3.421) (P< 0.001). In addition, there was a significantreduction in lightness (i.e., increase in darkness) within the charcoal groupafter the intervention (P< 0.001). There was no significant difference in chroma and hue between the charcoal and the whitening toothpaste groups (P> 0.05). Therewas no significant tooth loss nor roughness change (P= 0.867) for both groupswhen compared with natural tooth structure. Brushing teeth with the charcoalpaste tested for 21 days had no effect on tooth lightness, chroma, or hue.Charcoal powder had no significant effect on tooth surface roughness. CLINICALSIGNIFICANCE: The Premium Nature charcoal toothpaste tested had no toothwhitening effect.

AB  - In this work, the miscibility of blends of thermoplastic Achira Starch (AS) andpolylactic acid (PLA) was evaluated, assisted by Pluronic(R) F127 an amphiphilic triblock copolymer that acts as a surfactant and promotes the reduction ofsurface tension among AS and PLA in solution by emulsion stabilization. Differentformulations of AS/PLA blends were obtained at 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75 containing0 %, 4 %, and 8 % of Pluronic(R) F127, and glycerol was used as a plasticizer.Solvent casting was the method used to obtain blended polymeric films, which werecharacterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform InfraredSpectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA),differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wettability by contact anglemeasurements. The results demonstrate that miscibility of PLA in AS or vice versawas achieved. The stability of emulsion and posterior drying of the differentformulations allows the production of films for packaging, pharmaceutical, orbiomedical applications.

AB  - The increasing requirement and consumption of coal has resulted in a largeaccumulation of coal gangue. The reuse and recycling of coal gangue have become ahigh priority for sustainable development. A sustainable and efficient ceramsite adsorbent was prepared for copper ions adsorption by using coal gangue, coal fly ash, and copper slag as the main materials. The appropriate performance of theceramsite could be obtained at a mixture of coal gangue, coal fly ash, and copperslag at a weight ratio of 3:4:1. The optimal sintering temperature and time were 1050 degrees C and 20 min, respectively. The main crystalline phases of ceramsitewere quartz, mullite, and anorthite. Many micropores are connecting the interior on the surface of ceramsite under scanning electron microscope. The maximumcopper ions adsorption capacity reached up to 20.6 mg/g at 303 K when pH and timewere 5 and 1440 min, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm could be described by the pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich model, respectively.The adsorption mechanisms of Cu(2+) with ceramsite were attributed to Cu(OH)2precipitation formed on the alkaline surface of ceramsite and complexationreactions occurred between the O-containing groups (including C-O, Fe-O, andSi-O) from ceramsite and Cu(2+). The prepared ceramsite may be also applied toother heavy metal wastewater treatments.

AB  - The anatomical and histochemical characterization of pretreated substrates isessential for the further valorization of biomass during the biorefinery process.In this work, the benzenesulfonic acid (BA)-treated substrates were employed for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of ethanol for the firsttime. An ethanol yield of 50.36% was attained at 10% solids loading and 47.45 g/Lof ethanol accumulated at 30 % solids loading. The dramatic improvements couldresult from the deconstruction of cell walls, which were evidenced byfluorescence microscope and confocal Raman microscopy spectra. Additionally, for a thorough comprehension of the inherent chemistry of lignin during the BApretreatment, the changes in lignin structure features were identified for thefirst time by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In summary, this study tried to probe the possibility of BA-treatedMiscanthus for the SSF process and unveiled the mechanism of the efficient BApretreatment.

AB  - In this study, the core-shell of Fe3O4-Au nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared byseeding AuNPs onto Fe3O4 NPs modified with poly-ethylenimine (PEI). Later,Fe3O4-Au NPs were attached to cationic poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride)(PDDA)-modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets through in situ self-assemblybehaviors, termed as Fe3O4-Au@RGO nanocomposites, for surface-enhanced Ramanscattering (SERS) detection and hyperthermia treatment of bacteria. The resultingFe3O4-Au@RGO nanocomposites were evaluated systematically by transmissionelectron microscope, zeta potential, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. It revealed that the core-shell structured Fe3O4-Au NPs were dispersed homogeneously on the surface of the GOnanosheets. Furthermore, the rapid SERS detection for small biomolecules andbacteria was conducted by Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that thegreatest SERS intensity was fne tuned at the weight ratio of Fe3O4-Au/RGOnanosheets was 20/1, displaying the optimal interparticle gap of AuNPs to induce the huge hot-spots effect. The magnetic inductive heating capability ofFe3O4-Au@RGO nanocomposites was produced under high frequency magnetic fieldexposure and can kill high than 90% of the bacteria at 10 min. Hence, the newlydeveloped Fe3O4-Au@RGO nanocomposites were demonstrated to be viable for SERSdetection of biomolecules and microbes and potential applications formagnetically capturing and hyperthermia treatment of bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A blockage in a blood vessel can cause reduced blood flow to thebrain, which eventually leads to the death of surrounding tissue. Several studieshave attempted to develop an effective intervention to reverse this process andimprove the health status of affected individuals. Due to its indirect effect on cellular functions and metabolism, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha)protein has been proposed as a promising transcription factor in the treatment ofstroke. PURPOSE: The current study aims to explore the relation between HIF-1alpha and thymoquinone (TQ) in the attenuation of ischemic brain damage and thepossible mechanism of this relation to reduce cell death. METHODS: For thispurpose, dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), 8 mg/kg, Acriflavine (ACF), 1.5 mg/kg,and both combined with TQ (5 mg/kg) were assessed. Male C57 mice were used toestablish an ischemic stroke model by using endothelin-1 (ET-1) (400 pmole/mul)intra- cranial injection. The ultrastructure alterations of neuronal soma, axons,and mitochondria after stroke and treatment were well addressed. Besides, theexpression levels of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, Nrf2, and HO-1 were evaluated. Meanwhile, apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins were also investigated. RESULTS:Treatment of ischemic stroke by TQ can activate the HIF-1alpha pathway and itsdownstream genes such as VEGF, TrkB, and PI3K, which in turn enhance angiogenesisand neurogenesis. Our study revealed that TQ has the same effect as DMOG toactivate HIF-1 alpha and can improve motor dysfunction after ischemic stroke.Further, we demonstrated that both TQ and DMOG effectively attenuate theorganelle's damage following ischemic stroke, which was confirmed by thecryogenic transmission electron microscope. The synergistic effect of TQ and DMOGmay lead to a chemo-modulation action in the autophagy process after stroke onsetand this result is validated by the western blot and rt-qPCR techniques.CONCLUSION: Our finding revealed the potential role of TQ as a HIF-1 alphaactivator to reduce cell death, modulate autophagy and decrease the infarctvolume after ischemic stroke onset. The neuroprotective effect of TQ is achieved by decreasing the inflammation and increasing angiogenesis as well asneurogenesis via induction of the HIF-1alpha-VEGF/Nrf2-HO-1-TrkB-PI3K pathway.

TI  - UV-excited blue- to green-emitting Tb(3+) -activated sodium calcium metasilicate colour tunable phosphor for luminescence devices.
LID - 10.1002/bio.4319 [doi]
AB  - Tb(3+) -doped Na4 Ca4 Si6 O18 (NCMS:Tb(3+) ) phosphors were synthesized using asolid-state reaction route with increasing dopant concentration. The phaseidentification studies for NCMS:Tb(3+) phosphors were carried out using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The XRD patterns for the as-synthesized phosphorsshowed satisfactory agreement with the standard pattern (JCPDS card no. 75-1687) for the pure phase of the Na4 Ca4 Si6 O18 compound. The morphology and size ofparticles were illustrated from scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs.The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum of Tb(3+) -doped Na4 Ca4 Si6 O18 phosphor depicts the strong excitation peak obtained in the UV spectral region.The trivalent terbium-activated NCMS phosphors excited in the UV region (232 nmwavelength) exhibited intense emission in the blue (350-470) and green (470-650) spectral regions. When increasing the concentration of Tb(3+) ions in the hostmatrix, the emission colour shifted from the blue to the green region due tocross-relaxation energy transfer (CRET) mechanisms and showed the tunablebehaviour of the Tb(3+) -activated as-synthesized NCMS phosphor. These resultsdemonstrated that the Tb(3+) -activated sodium calcium metasilicate phosphor has immense potential to contribute as a green- and blue-green-emitting component in lighting and display device applications.

TI  - Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 Expression in the Spinal Motor Neurons of Patients WithSporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
PG  - 463-469
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2022.18.4.463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motorneuron disease. Selective deficiency of edited adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), a key molecule in the acquisition of Ca(2+) resistance in motorneurons, has been reported in sporadic ALS (sALS) spinal motor neurons. SinceADAR2 activity is positively regulated by prolyl isomerase Protein never inmitosis gene A interacting-1 (Pin1), a known phosphorylation-dependentpeptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, we investigated Pin1 expression in spinalmotor neurons in sALS. METHODS: Specimens of the spinal cord were obtained fromthe lumbar region in eight sALS patients and age-matched five controls afterpostmortem examinations. The specimens were double stained with anti-Pin1 andanti-TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) antibodies, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: This study analyzed 254 and 422 spinal motorneurons from 8 sALS patients and 5 control subjects, respectively. The frequency of motor neurons with high cytoplasmic Pin1 expression from the spinal cord didnot differ significantly between sALS specimens without cytoplasmic TDP-43inclusions and control specimens. However, in sALS specimens, neurons for whichthe Pin1 immunoluminescence intensity in the cytoplasm was at least twice that inthe background were more common in specimens with cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions(p<0.05 in chi(2) test). CONCLUSIONS: In sALS, neurons with higher expressionlevels of Pin1 levels had more TDP-43 inclusions. Despite the feedback mechanism between Pin1 and ADAR2 being unclear, since Pin1 positively regulates ADAR2, our results suggest that higher Pin1 expression levels in motor neurons with TDP-43pathology from sALS patients represent a compensatory mechanism.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of 3D Slicer preoperative planning andintraoperative guidance with mobile phone virtual reality (VR) technology onbrain glioma surgery. Methods: By means of retrospective study, the data of 77brain glioma patients treated in the neurosurgery departments at The SecondAffiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College and Xinhua Hospital Affiliated toShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from January 2015 to January2022 were analyzed, and the patients were divided into the experimental group(EG, n = 38) and the control group (CG, n = 39) according to the surgicalmodalities. Before surgery, all patients received positron emissiontomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) examination. For patients in EG, the DICOM format images acquired fromPET-CT and MRI examinations were imported with the 3D Slicer software for 3Dvisual fusion reconstruction, acquiring VR images, and developing detailedpreoperative planning. Then, the reconstructed images were imported into the Sinasoftware on a mobile phone, and the surgery was performed with the assistance of VR technology; for patients in CG, traditional 2D images were used for tumorcontour drawing by the subjective visual method, and the craniotomy was performedunder a traditional microscope. Patients' surgery indicators and KarnofskyPerformance Scale (KPS) scores were compared between the two groups. Results: Thenumber of cases with total resection, rate of total resection, hospital stayafter surgery, and surgery time were significantly better in EG than in CG (P <0.05); after treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in EG than in CG(75.66 +/- 4.01 vs 65.36 +/- 5.23, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Combining 3D Slicerpreoperative planning with intraoperative mobile phone VR technology can promote the accuracy of brain glioma surgery, which is conducive to effectively removing tumors while protecting patients' neural function.

TI  - Surface-mediated high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ofastaxanthin-loaded ultrathin graphene oxide film that inhibits the overproductionof intracellular reactive oxygen species.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/s40824-022-00276-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin (AST) is known as a powerful antioxidant that affects theremoval of active oxygen and inhibits the production of lipid peroxide caused by ultraviolet light. However, it is easily decomposed by heat or light duringproduction and storage because of the unsaturated compound nature with astructural double bond. The activity of AST can be reduced and lose itsantioxidant capability. Graphene oxide (GO) is an ultrathin nanomaterial producedby oxidizing layered graphite. The chemical combination of AST with GO canimprove the dispersion properties to maintain structural stability andantioxidant activity because of the tightly bonded functionalized GO surface.METHODS: Layered GO films were used as nanocarriers for the AST molecule, whichwas produced via flow-enabled self-assembly and subsequent controlled solutiondeposition of RGD peptide and AST molecules. Synthesis of the GO-AST complex was also carried out for the optimized concentration. The characterization ofprepared materials was analyzed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM),scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR), atomic force microscope (AFM), and Raman spectroscopy. Antioxidantactivity was tested by 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)(ABTS) and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. The antibacterial effect and antioxidant effects were monitored for the ultrathin GO/RGD/AST Film.Further, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay was used to evaluate theanti-inflammatory effects on L-929 fibroblasts. RESULTS: Cotreatment of GO-ASTsolution demonstrated a high antioxidant combined effect with a high ABTS andDPPH radicals scavenging activity. The GO/RGD/AST film was produced by theself-assembly process exhibited excellent antibacterial effects based onphysicochemical damage against E. coli and S. aureus. In addition, the GO/RGD/ASTfilm inhibited H2O2-induced intracellular ROS, suppressed the toxicity oflipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cells, and restored it, thereby exhibitingstrong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. CONCLUSION: As GOnanocarrier-assisted AST exerted promising antioxidant and antibacterialreactions, presented a new concept to expand basic research into the field oftissue engineering.

AB  - This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of auniversal adhesive to contaminated/non-contaminated dentin when applied withthree different protocols. One-hundred-eighty dentin samples were dividedrandomly into 12 groups (n=15). The groups were created by combining four dentin contamination conditions (non-contaminated or contaminated with blood,hemostatic, or blood+hemostatic) with three application protocols for Single BondUniversal (no-preconditioning or preconditioning with the 35% phosphoric or 1%gallic acid). Following thermal cycling, the SBS test was performed. Data wereanalyzed using two-way-ANOVA and Tukey's HSD (p<0.05). Dentin surfaces subjected to phosphoric acid, gallic acid, or hemostatic were examined using scanningelectron microscope (SEM) analysis. SBS results were influenced by both thedentin contamination (p<0.001) and application protocol (p<0.001). A significant interaction was found between the two factors (p=0.005). The highest bondingperformance to contaminated dentin -at all contamination conditions- was achievedwith the gallic acid preconditioning.

AB  - The present study examined color changes in the tooth-colored restorativematerials, zirconia (3Y-TZP), resin composite, and porcelain. The colors (CIELab)of these materials were measured using a spectrophotometer. Specimens wereimmersed in black tea or curry for 1 and 7 days, after which colors werere-assessed. Color differences (E(*)ab) before and after immersion werecalculated. Specimens after the 7-day immersion were ultrasonically cleaned, and colors were measured again to assess the color recovery rate. The surface freeenergy, roughness, and water sorption/solubility of each material were alsoevaluated. Specimens were observed under a scanning electron microscope. TheE(*)ab of 3Y-TZP was the smallest with both immersions. Resin composite had thesmallest recovery rate. The surface free energy and roughness of 3Y-TZP weresmaller than those of porcelain. 3Y-TZP and porcelain showed almost no sorptionduring the 7-day period. The present results revealed that 3Y-TZP exhibited thestrongest resistance to discoloration.

TI  - The noble metals M (M = Pd, Ag, Au) decorated CeO2catalysts derived from solutioncombustion method for efficient low-temperature CO catalytic oxidation: effectsof different M loading on catalytic performances.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/ac7ed3 [doi]
AB  - The noble metal nanoparticles have attracted attention due to their excellentcatalytic performance for CO oxidation at low temperatures. M-CeO2(M = Pd, Ag,Au) catalysts with different atomic ratios of M/Ce were deposited via solutioncombustion method. Among them, 3 at% Pd-CeO2, 5 at% Ag-CeO2and 1 at%Au-CeO2catalysts have better catalytic performances. Especially, 5 at%Ag-CeO2catalyst shows better low-temperature CO oxidation performance. Thecatalytic activity for CO oxidation follows the follows the following sequence: 5at% Ag-CeO2(T50 = 69 degrees C) > 3 at% Pd-CeO2(T50 = 99 degrees C) >1 at%Au-CeO2(T50 = 115 degrees C). Meanwhile, the catalysts are characterized by meansof powder x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and H2-TPR. The characterization results show that the 5at% Ag-CeO2catalyst has excellent catalytic activity due to the good dispersionof Ag nanoparticles, the specific surface area of the material, and the reductioncatalyst between different valence ions. Moreover, the surface of the catalystenhances the mutual synergy, effectively promotes the generation of oxygenvacancies, and increases the active oxygen content of the catalyst surface.Finally, the catalytic mechanism of M-CeO2catalysts is summarized.

TI  - Contactless Measurement of Integrity of Silicone Coating on Self-ExpandableEsophageal Nitinol Stents.
PG  - 18-24
LID - 10.14712/18059694.2022.11 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A stent is a mesh tube inserted into a natural passage in the body toprevent disease induction. Self-expandable esophageal nitinol stents such asSX-ELLA Stent Esophageal HV (HV Stent Plus) can be indicated for palliation ofmalignant esophageal strictures, for the treatment of benign esophagealstrictures that are refractory to standard therapy and for the treatment ofesophago-respiratory fistulas. A silicone-stent coating is used for tumorin-growth prevention and esophago-respiratory fistula occlusion. The thickness ofthe stent and the overall integrity of the silicone coating of all wires indicatethe overall mechanical properties of the esophageal stent and the resistance toexternal adverse events such as corrosion and mechanical and chemical resistance.METHODS: The polymer multicomponent epoxy resin - a mixture of Epon and Durcupan - was used as a method for robust sample stabilization. A cutting system using a thin water beam with a powder (Blue Line) was chosen as the best variant toobtain 6 samples for both-sided measurement (10 measuring sides). The opticalmicroscopic reflective light method was used to examine wire crossing points inthe sections. Fifty values were measured on either sample side for the internal, external and mesh thickness of the silicone stent layer. The wire crossing pointswere selected so that the silicone layer structure could be clearly seen, and thewires approached each other most closely. Only approximately 4 to 8 crossingpoints in each section could be measured when applying this approach. Theresolution of the microscope and calibration (based on the camera used) was 0.677mum/pixel. RESULTS: Additional data could be obtained on 8 planes. Two boundarysamples were destroyed by the cutting process. Whole coating of the stent wasaround all mesh wires, especially in areas with higher mechanical stress (wirecrossing). The minimum detectable and admissible value determined for all 3measuring areas (internal, external, mesh) on the wire crossings was 6.77 mum,i.e., 10 pixels, based on the microscope resolution and manufacturer'smethodology. The results were characterized by p < 0.001 for all 3 parameters. Wetested opposite samples in each section to verify the section quality and dataconsistency. For the 4 areas, the data were significantly different, but thethickness differences were only on the order of units percent, so themeasurements were not appreciably affected. We assume that the material cuttingloss, making up 1-2 mm, contributed to the differences in the sections.CONCLUSION: We examined the overall integrity of the silicone coating of theesophageal stent. The method of HV stent anchoring in a polymeric bath followedby cutting with a waterjet and sample measurement under an optical microscopeproved to be very simple and reliable. Sufficient thicknesses of the siliconelayer on the wire cross sections were verified. The coated silicone layerthickness appeared to be significantly different along the stent from theproximal part to the distant part, presumably due to the manufacturingtechnology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the structural and physical propertiesbetween normal bovine milk and A2 bovine milk fermented using commercialfermentation bacteria mixing with/without Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MWLp-12and Limosilactobacillus fermentum MWLf-4 screening from human milk. ScanningElectron Microscopy (SEM), SDS-PAGE and inverted fluorescence microscope wereused for analyzing the structural differences. Titratable acidity and pH, waterholding capacity, rheology, texture performances, and chromaticity value weredetermined for evaluating differences in the physical properties. We found thatA2 fermented milk had better viscosity characteristics and stable structure than normal fermented milk. Importantly, the significant differences in structure and physical properties would affirm that differences structures were existing incasein micelle between normal bovine milk and A2 bovine milk. In addition, theaddition of MWLp-12 and MWLf-4 strains could enhance the proteolysis and bring inmore pilotaxitic texture leading to the fermented milk possessing a greatertexture performance. Therefore, this study will be an interest to the dairyindustry for developing novel dairy products, and the two strains will be thepotential probiotics to be applied on fermented milk preparation.

AB  - This research explores the possibilities of a dual-chamber microbial fuel cell asa biosensor to measure Bisphenol A (BPA) in wastewater. BPA is an organiccompound and is considered to be an endocrine disruptor, affecting exposedorganisms, the environment, and human health. The performance of the microbialfuel cells (MFCs) was first controlled with specific operational conditions (pH, temperature, fuel feeding rate, and organic loading rate) to obtain the bestaccuracy of the sensor signal. After that, BPA concentrations varying from 50 to 1000 mug L(-1) were examined under the biosensor's cell voltage generation. Theoutcome illustrates that MFC generates the most power under the best possibleconditions of neutral pH, 300 mg L(-1) of COD, R 1000 Omega, and ambienttemperature. In general, adding BPA improved the biosensor's cell voltagegeneration. A slight linear trend between voltage output generation and BPAconcentration was observed with R(2) 0.96, which indicated that BPA in thisparticular concentration range did not real harm to the MFC's electrogenicbacteria. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed a better coverbiofilm after BPA injection on the surface electrode compared to it without BPA. These results confirmed that electroactive biofilm-based MFCs can serve to detectBPA found in wastewaters.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential antimicrobialand cytotoxic effect of modified 3D printed resin with ZrO2 nanoparticles, aslong-term provisional restoration. In addition, the study involved artificialaging process for three months to observe stability of 3D printed resin. METHODS:Functionalized ZrO2 nanoparticles with gamma-MPS were characterized usingtransmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscope andFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Dental resin was incrementallyimpregnated with gamma-MPS modified nanoparticles at different concentrations (0,1, 3, and 5 wt%). Specimens were printed, post-cured and placed in artificialsaliva at 37 (o)C for 48 h or aged for 3 months. Discrepancy in composition androughness were monitored using FTIR and AFM, respectively. Biocompatibility wasevaluated using human oral fibroblasts. Antimicrobials capacity and biofilmadhesion were measured with Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. RESULTS:The microscopic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed gamma-MPS coating aroundZrO2 nanoparticles. The addition of nanoparticles (>1 wt%) significantlyincreased the surface roughness. Cytotoxicity results were in agreement with the recommended range of oral biomaterials standard. Moreover, the antimicrobialactivity significantly improved with increasing the filler concentration. Despitethe decrease in antimicrobial efficacy after 3 months of aging, modified resinrevealed a critical ability to dominate biofilm formation. SIGNIFICANCE: Theaddition of ZrO2 nanoparticles showed significant antimicrobial capability of a3D printed resin without inducing any cellular side effects. Thus, themodification of a 3D printed resin with ZrO2 nanoparticles has a promising futurein the dental field for fabricating long-term provisional restorations.

AB  - Objective To analyze the clinicopathological characteristics of lymphadenitiscaused by Talaromyces marneffei (TM).Method s The clinical data,pathologicalfeatures,pathogen examination,and treatment of 15 cases of TM-causedlymphadenitis were analyzed retrospectively.Results The 15 cases included 14males and 1 females,who were aged 26-67 years,with an average age of(49.1+/-11.87) years.The 15 cases,including 13 cases of acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome and 2 cases of diabetes mellitus,were accompanied by superficial lymphnode enlargement in the neck and supraclavicular,axillary,and inguinalregions.The structure of cord-like lymph node tissue punctured by thick needlewas completely or partially replaced by inflammatory lesions. Under microscope,8 cases showed mainly diffuse infiltration of phagocytes with pathogens;5 casespresented mainly extensive coagulation necrosis with a small amount of pathogens and nuclear debris;2 cases were characterized by small nodular hyperplasia offibroblasts,formation of granulomatous structure,and scattered distribution of a few multinucleated giant cells.The pathogens were relatively consistent in sizeand shape,which were round,oval or sausage-shaped and clustered likemulberry.Diastase periodic acid-Schiff staining and hexamine silver staininghighlighted the bacterial structure with transverse septum.TM growth was detectedin the blood,alveolar lavage fluid,sputum or lymph node extract fungal culture ofthe 15 patients.Owing to the adequate antifungal treatment in time,these 15patients were discharged after their conditions were improved.ConclusionLymphadenitis is one of the major manifestations of the systemic invasion of TMat the late stage,which is tended to be misdiagnosed.Through core needle biopsyof lymph node,it can be diagnosed as soon as possible to avoid delayed treatment and improve the cure rate.

AB  - Metasurfaces constitute a powerful approach to generate and control light byengineering optical material properties at the subwavelength scale. Recently,this concept was applied to manipulate free-electron radiation phenomena,rendering versatile light sources with unique functionalities. In this Letter, weexperimentally demonstrate spectral and angular control over coherent lightemission by metasurfaces that interact with free-electrons under grazingincidence. Specifically, we study metalenses based on chirped metagratings thatsimultaneously emit and shape Smith-Purcell radiation in the visible andnear-infrared spectral regime. In good agreement with theory, we observe thefar-field signatures of strongly convergent and divergent cylindrical radiationwavefronts using in situ hyperspectral angle-resolved light detection in ascanning electron microscope. Furthermore, we theoretically explore simultaneous control over the polarization and wavefront of Smith-Purcell radiation via asplit-ring-resonator metasurface, enabling tunable operation by spatiallyselective mode excitation at nanometer resolution. Our work highlights thepotential of merging metasurfaces with free-electron excitations for versatileand highly tunable radiation sources in wide-ranging spectral regimes.

AB  - We aimed to study the histopathological and immunohistochemistry features inclinically diagnosed cases of nanophthalmos using light microscopy. This was anobservational comparative study. We enrolled four eyes of four consecutivepatients with nanophthalmos and visually significant cataract, who underwentcataract surgery with prophylactic posterior sclerostomy. Histological analysisof the excised scleral tissue was done and compared with age-matched cadavercontrols between January 2021 and October 2021. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)stains were used for histological analysis, and was further supplemented withimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses using a simplelight microscope. The immunostained sections were analyzed using confocalmicroscope for the fibronectin expression level. The main outcome measure wasdemonstration of histological changes of sclera in nanophthalmic eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Light microscopic features of nanophthalmos revealed thickfibers with fraying and lightly stained cores, irregular serrated edges, andrandomly interspersed fibroblasts compared to regular arrangement of collagenfibers seen in cadaver controls. Immunohistochemistry analysis withanti-fibronectin antibody showed strong positivity in clustered fibers innanophthalmos, and less intense diffuse staining in cadaver tissue. Histoclinicalcorrelation was observed in one nanophthalmic scleral tissue with axial lengthless than 17 mm showing severe disorganization with diffuse collagenization, lossof fibrillary architecture compared to another specimen with axial length morethan 17 mm. Simple, cost-effective light microscopy using basic stains waseffective in identifying the characteristic histopathological features innanophthalmic eyes, and this was further highlighted by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses.

TI  - Actions of N-acetylcysteine, daptomycin, vancomycin, and linezolid onmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in the ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections: an experimental study.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s41016-022-00284-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shunt systems are used to provide cerebrospinal fluid drainage in thetreatment of hydrocephalus. Recently, antibiotic-impregnated shunt systems areused to prevent colonization in the ventriculoperitoneal catheters.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most common causativemicroorganism of shunt infections. The aim of the study is to investigate effectsof several substances on MRSA biofilms in the ventriculoperitoneal catheters.METHODS: The present study consists of mainly eight groups (each has twosubgroups as antibiotic-impregnated and nonantibiotic-impregnated catheters). In addition, each group contains six molds using MRSA strains. In this study,daptomycin (DAPT) (2 mg/ml), vancomycin (VAN) (10 mg/ml), linezolid (LIN) (2mg/ml), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (6 mg/ml), and various combinations of thesesubstances were used to evaluate the treatment against MRSA using scanningelectron microscope (SEM) images and microbiological enumeration. RESULTS: Thecolony count in the antibiotic-impregnated samples significantly decreasedcompared to nonantibiotic-impregnated samples in the MRSA, MRSA + DAPT, and MRSA + LIN groups (p < 0.01), respectively. Conversely, the colony count inantibiotic-impregnated samples significantly increased compared tononantibiotic-impregnated samples in NAC + DAPT and NAC + VAN groups (p < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the use ofantibiotic-impregnated catheters has a significant impact on the prevention ofinfection whereas the combination of NAC and DAPT showed better antibiofilm andantibacterial effects than other combinations on the prevention and treatment of nonantibiotic-impregnated catheter infections.

AB  - Hydrophilic photocatalytically active ZnO and ZnO thin films doped with Yb2O3 andEu2O3 (rare earth metal oxide, REM) with optical transmittance exceeding 76% inthe visible light range (lambda = 550 nm) were prepared by a combination ofsol-gel technique, spin-coating and high temperature thermal treatment at 500 and600 degrees C. The thin films were tested using advanced research methods, i.e.: morphology and topography and fractures along with approximate thickness valueswere investigated on scanning electron microscope (SEM), chemical composition wasdetermined using X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (X-ray EnergySpectroscopy), topography and roughness were measured on atomic force microscope (AFM), water contact angle values were determined by sitting water dropletmethod, optical properties of the fabricated materials were investigated usingUV/Vis spectrophotometer. The decolorization efficiency of rhodamine B in aqueoussolution was analyzed over a period of 190 min, obtaining degradation rates of:54.7% and 43.1%, for ZnO and ZnO coatings doped with ytterbium oxide and europiumoxide, respectively. The roughness of thin hybrid coatings did not exceed 50 nm, ensuring effective absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the layers. Themethodology presented by the authors for the fabrication of thin hybrid filmscharacterized by the key properties of self-cleaning coatings can be successfullyapplied to coatings of photovoltaic panels and architectural glass structures.

PG  - 1045-1061
LID - 10.1007/s00276-022-02981-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional relationships within the limbic and paralimbicareas are often hard to grasp. Relevant anatomical structures exhibit acomplicated architecture and connectivity and therefore surgical approachestargeting lesions or functional resections in this area pose a distinctchallenge. PURPOSE: To provide an educational, comprehensive, systematic andstepwise manual for the dissection and illustration of major limbic structuressince there is a gap in the pertinent literature. Further, we aim to offer athorough yet simplified roadmap for laboratory and intraoperative dissections.METHODS: Twenty (20) normal adult, formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres werestudied through the fiber dissection technique and under the microscope. Stepwiseand in tandem medial to lateral and lateral to medial dissections were performed in all specimens aiming to reveal the morphology and spatial relationships ofmajor limbic and paralimbic areas. RESULTS: Fourteen (14) consecutive, discreteand easily reproducible laboratory anatomical steps are systematically described to reveal the intricate anatomy of the limbic and paralimbic structures and theirmain connections. CONCLUSION: This study offers for the first time in thepertinent literature a focused, step-by-step laboratory manual for the dissectionand illustration of the limbic and paralimbic structures. The overreaching goalis to supplement the novice and experienced anatomist and neurosurgeon with athorough and systematic reference to facilitate laboratory or intraoperativedissections.

AB  - Objective: To study the cross-sectional morphology of root canal system ofTibetan mandibular incisors by micro-CT. Methods: From October 2019 to October2020, one hundred and thirty-six mandibular incisors were collected from Tibetan patients [(51.9+/-16.4) years old, range from 25 to 80 years] who underwent teethextraction due to severe periodontitis at the Department of Stomatology, Tibetan Hospital of Traditional Tibetan Medicine, including 84 mandibular centralincisors and 52 mandibular lateral incisors. These teeth were scanned at 23 mumvoxel size resolution. Root lengths from cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to apex ofmandibular incisors were measured. According to the length, the root was divided as cervical 1/3, middle 1/3 and apical 1/3, and the numbers of root canals wererecorded simultaneously. The major diameter, minor diameter, and dimension weremeasured per millimeter in cross section for mandibular incisor with single root canal, and the ratio of major diameter to minor diameter (Dmax/Dmin) as well asroundness were calculated for morphological analysis. The diversions andconversions from CEJ to apex in cross section were recorded for mandibularincisor with multiple root canals. Results: For mandibular central incisors with single root canal, the Dmax/Dmin was highest in middle 1/3 of the root [1.99(1.31, 2.79)], which was significantly higher than cervical 1/3 and apical 1/3(P=0.010, P=0.003). The roundness was least in middle 1/3 [0.47 (0.31, 0.66)],which was significantly lower than cervical 1/3 and apical 1/3 (P=0.010,P=0.001). For mandibular central incisor with multiple root canals, the highestincidence of multiple root canals was 40.5% (34/84), and mainly detected inmiddle 1/3 of the root [32.1% (27/84)]. For mandibular lateral incisor withsingle root canal, the roundness was greatest in apical 1/3 of the root [0.61(0.49, 0.71)], which was significantly higher than cervical 1/3 (P=0.001) andmiddle 1/3 (P=0.001). The highest incidence of multiple root canals was 34.6%(18/52), all of which were detected in apical 1/3. Conclusions: In Tibetanmandibular central incisors, the cross-sectional morphology of root canals waslong and narrow in middle 1/3, and multiple root canals were more likely to befound here. In Tibetan mandibular lateral incisors, the cross-sectional anatomyof root canal was relatively close to circle in apical 1/3, but the shape wasstill so irregular that one root canal may divide into two here.

LID - 10.1002/jemt.24189 [doi]
AB  - Electrospinning technique became a very common and effective method to fabricate nonwoven films with a large surface area for different purposes especially in thebiomedical field. Antimicrobial submicron fibrous films based onpolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) doped with silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), Zinc Oxide(ZnO), and (Ag-NPS/ZnO), were successfully fabricated via the electrospinningtechnique. The morphology and the elemental configurations of the as-preparedfilms were studied by using scanning electron microscope with EDX. While thephase formation and crystal structures were determined by using XRD analysis. Theantibacterial effect was investigated against one of the most commonGram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae by using a modified Kirby-Bauer discdiffusion method. The results showed that the doping nanoparticles were uniformlyloaded on the surface of the fabricated film fibers. By using Scherrer equationthe calculated average crystallite sizes of Ag-NPs, ZnO, and Ag-NPs/ZnO on PVPfibers were 63, 30, and 44 nm, respectively. The antimicrobial activity againstKlebsiella pneumoniae showed the growth inhibition zones in the bacteria platesof 23.3, 54, and 60.6 mm for the samples of Ag-NPs/PVP, ZnO/PVP, andAg-NPs/ZnO/PVP, respectively. The antimicrobial efficiency increased by formingnanocomposites of both ZnO nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles inside the film.

TI  - SAXS-guided unbiased coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation for identification of self-assembly nanostructures and dimensions.
PG  - 5282-5292
LID - 10.1039/d2sm00601d [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that solvated amphiphiles can form nanostructuredself-assemblies called dynamic binary complexes (DBCs) in the presence of ions.Since the nanostructures of DBCs are directly related to their viscoelasticproperties, it is important to understand how the nanostructures change underdifferent solution conditions. However, it is challenging to obtain athree-dimensional molecular description of these nanostructures by utilizingconventional experimental characterization techniques or thermodynamic models. Tothis end, we combined the structural data from small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS) experiments and thermodynamic knowledge from coarse-grained Monte Carlo(CGMC) simulations to identify the detailed three-dimensional nanostructure ofDBCs. Specifically, unbiased CGMC simulations are performed with SAXS-guidedinitial conditions, which aids us to sample accurate nanostructures in acomputationally efficient fashion. As a result, an elliptical bilayernanostructure is obtained as the most probable nanostructure of DBCs whosedimensions are validated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Then,utilizing the obtained molecular model of DBCs, we could also explain the pHtunability of the system. Overall, our results from SAXS-guided unbiased CGMCsimulations highlight that using potential energy combined with SAXS data, we candistinguish otherwise degenerate nanostructures resulting from the inherentambiguity of SAXS patterns.

LID - 10.1002/jssc.202200365 [doi]
AB  - In the present research, an ultrasound-assisted magnetic solid-phase extractioncoupled with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry hybrid system was developedfor the extraction/determination of trace amounts of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons in high-consumption soft drinks and non-alcoholic beers in Iranusing magnetite graphene oxide adsorbent. The magnetite graphene oxide wascharacterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and vibrating-sample magnetometer techniques. The highest extraction recovery (73.05%-95.56%) andenrichment factor (90.65-106.38) were obtained at adsorbent mass: 10 mg,adsorption time: 30 min, salt addition: sodium chloride 10% w/v, desorption time:20 min, eluent type: hexane: acetone (1:1, v/v), and desorption solvent volumes: 200 mul. Under optimum conditions, the linearity range for polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons determination was 0.2-200 ng/ml with a coefficient of determination > 0.993, the limit of detection = 0.09-0.21 ng/ml, the limit of quantitation =0.3-0.7 ng/ml, and relative standard deviation < 8.1%, respectively. Relativerecoveries in spiked real samples ranged from 94.67% to 109.45% with a standarddeviation < 6.05%. The proposed method is effective, sensitive, and reusable and it is promising for the analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons residues in environmental samples.

TI  - Prussian Blue-Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing Photocatalytic Water OxidationPerformance of BiVO4.
LID - 10.1002/chem.202201407 [doi]
AB  - The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction is usuallylimited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron transferprocesses of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 )as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the wateroxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination ofphotogenerated electron-hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M II -Co III Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn)cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO 4 for boostingthe surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO 4 . Six M II -Co III PBAs@BiVO 4 photocatalysts alldemonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to thatof BiVO 4 alone. Among them, the Co-Co PBA@BiVO 4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized byelectrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopicanalyses. Notably, BiVO 4 coupling with Co-Co PBA cocatalyst could capture morephotons than that of pure BiVO 4 , facilitating the transfer of photogeneratedcharge carriers between BiVO 4 and Co-Co PBA as well as surface catalyticefficiency of BiVO 4 . Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategydevelopment for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for wateroxidation.

TI  - A computational approach to model gliding motion of an organism on a sticky slimelayer over a solid substrate.
LID - 10.1007/s10237-022-01600-6 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria are microscopic single-celled microbes that can only be spotted via amicroscope. They occur in a variety of shapes and sizes, and their dimensions aremeasured in micrometers (one-millionth of a meter). Bacterial categorization isbased on a variety of features such as morphology, DNA sequencing, presence offlagella, cell structure, staining techniques, oxygen, and carbon-dioxiderequirements. Due to these classifications, gliding bacteria are a miscellaneous class of rodlike microorganisms that cling and propel over ooze slime connectedwith a substrate. Without the assistance of flagella, which are essential partsof bacterial motility, the organism movement is adopted by waves streaming downthe outer layer of this microorganism. To simulate the locomotion of such glidingmicroorganisms, a wavy sheet over Oldroyd-4 constant fluid is utilized. Under thelong wavelength assumption, the equations regulating the flow of slime (modeledas Oldroyd-4 constant slime) beneath the cell/organism are developed. Thequantities such as slime flow rate, cell speed, and propulsion power are computedby using bvp4c (MATLAB routine) integrated with the modified Newton-Rasphsontechnique. Furthermore, the flow patterns and velocity of the slime aregraphically shown and thoroughly described using precise (calculated) values ofthe cell speed and velocity of the slime.

TI  - Molecular homogeneity of GB1 revealed by single molecule force spectroscopy.
PG  - 9925-9931
LID - 10.1039/d2nr02614g [doi]
AB  - In single molecule studies, the ergodic hypothesis is inherently assumed, whichstates that the time average of a physical quantity of a single member of anensemble is the same as the average of the same quantity on the whole ensemble ata given time. This hypothesis implies the homogeneity of a molecular ensemble of a system of interest. However, it is difficult to test the validity of theergodic hypothesis experimentally. Recent theoretical work suggested thatheterogeneity may be widely present in single molecule force spectroscopystudies. Here we used atomic force microscope based single molecule forcespectroscopy to examine the molecular homogeneity/heterogeneity of a smallglobular protein GB1 in its mechanical unfolding reaction. Using a polyprotein(GB1)4, we directly measured the ensemble average and time average for a singlemolecule of the mechanical unfolding force and kinetic parameters thatcharacterize the mechanical unfolding free energy profile of GB1. Our resultsshowed that the ensemble averages of these physical quantities are indeed thesame as the time averages for single molecules, and individual molecules did not show any differences amongst them in these physical quantities. These results areconsistent with the expectation of the ergodic hypothesis and indicate that GB1is a homogeneous molecular ensemble in its mechanical unfolding reaction on thetime scale of our force spectroscopy experiments.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the safety and function ofpoly(lactic-acid-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PLCL)/fibrinogen nanofibers (P/F-Ns), and provide theoretical basis for the clinical application. The surfacemorphology, mechanical properties, the hydrophilicity and the fibrinogen content of P/F-Ns were tested by scanning electron microscope, the material testingmachine, the contact angle meter and the microplate reader, respectively. Thecell adhesion, proliferation and ligament remodeling genes expression of Hig-82cells on P/F-Ns were conducted through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and real-time quantitative PCR analyses, respectively. The results showed that with theincrease of the fibrinogen content, the pore sizes and hydrophilicity of threeP/F-Ns increased, but the mechanical properties decreased. Cell adhesion andproliferation tests showed that P/F-N-2 held the best ability to promote celladhesion and proliferation. The ligament remodeling genes expressions of Hig-82cells on P/F-N-1, P/F-N-2 and P/F-N-3 were all up-regulated compared to P/F-N-0on days 3 and 7. All the three P/F-Ns containing fibrinogen (P/F-N-1, P/F-N-2 andP/F-N-3) had better biocompatibility compared to P/F-N-0, and could beefficiently applied to the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament.

AB  - This study presents the preparation of cellulose micro-nanofibrils (CMNFs) fromEnteromorpha (EP) and the application in PVA/acetylated distarch phosphate(ADSP)/CMNFs composite films. The Micro-nano scale, hydrophilicity, and stronghydrogen bond characteristics of CMNFs prepared form EP by acid hydrolysis wereconfirmed through the granular statistics, XRD analysis and chemical structureanalysis. With the addition of CMNFs, the ultimate tensile strength andelongation at break of composite films are increased by 42.4% and 90.3%. Anoriginal Weibull statistical analysis shows the impact of CMNFs' added amount on strength distribution and ultimate stress. SEM and polarizing microscope imagesshow the CMNFs' dispersion state in that films is optimal, when their additionwas to be 2%-3% of total dry weight of PVA/ADSP matrix which is consistent withthe results of Weibull modulus analysis. The main thermal weight-loss process of the composite film is divided into four stages, CMNFs can significantly increase the thermostability at 280 degrees C to 400 degrees C. The experiment of watercontact angle and water vapor transmission rate of the composite films confirmed that CMNFs can improve films' hydrophilicity. This study provides basis for thepreparation of hydrophilic CMNFs and mechanism of modification study PVA-basedcomposites.

AB  - The newly constructed time-resolved atomic, molecular and optical scienceinstrument (TMO) is configured to take full advantage of both linear acceleratorsat SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the copper accelerator operating at arepetition rate of 120 Hz providing high per-pulse energy as well as thesuperconducting accelerator operating at a repetition rate of about 1 MHzproviding high average intensity. Both accelerators power a soft X-rayfree-electron laser with the new variable-gap undulator section. With thisflexible light source, TMO supports many experimental techniques not previouslyavailable at LCLS and will have two X-ray beam focus spots in line. Thereby, TMO supports atomic, molecular and optical, strong-field and nonlinear science andwill also host a designated new dynamic reaction microscope with a sub-micrometerX-ray focus spot. The flexible instrument design is optimized for studyingultrafast electronic and molecular phenomena and can take full advantage of thesub-femtosecond soft X-ray pulse generation program.

TI  - Bacterial leaf blight of Polyscias guilfoylei caused by a novel pathovar ofXanthomonas euvesicatoria.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-22-0602-RE [doi]
AB  - Polyscias guilfoylei is a popular ornamental belonging to the Araliaceae family. The present study identified and characterized bacterial strains causing leaflesions on P. guilfoylei in a nursery in Taiwan. Strains Pgu1 to Pgu5 wereisolated from infected leaf tissues and Koch's Postulates were fulfilled.Observation of Pgu1 under a transmission electron microscope revealed that itscells were single-flagellated and rod-shaped. Sequencing of Pgu1 to Pgu5' 16SrDNA showed that they belong to the genus Xanthomonas. Thebiochemical/physiological traits of these bacteria were determined, and many ofthem also resemble those of other xanthomonads. However, the strains were unable to produce yellow pigments typically found in most members of the Xanthomonasgenus, even when grown on yeast dextrose calcium carbonate (YDC) agar.Physiological assays and phylogenetic analyses based on multiple loci showed thatthe isolates were closely associated with members of the species X. euvesicatoriaand phylogenetically distant from X. hortorum pv. hederae, the currently onlyknown xanthomonad capable of inducing diseases on Polyscias species. Artificialinoculation into different host plants revealed that a representative strain,Pgu1, is specialized to Polyscias guilfoylei and perhaps other members of theAraliaceae family. Based on the results from the phylogenetic and phenotypicanalyses, the present work concludes that these strains belong to a novelpathovar of X. euvesicatoria. The pathovar epiphet polysciadis is proposed.

AB  - Simultaneous observation of drug distribution at the effector site and subsequentcell response are essential in the drug development process. However, few studieshave visualized the drug itself and biomolecular interactions in living cells.Here, we used label-free Raman microscopy to investigate drug-inducedcytotoxicity and visualize drug uptake and subcellular localization by itsspecific molecular fingerprint. A redox-sensitive Raman microscope detected thedecrease of reduced cytochrome c (cyt c) after Actinomycin D (ActD) treatment in a time-dependent and dose-dependent format. Immunofluorescence staining of cyt c suggested that the release of cyt c was not the major cause. Combining Ramanmicroscopy with conventional biological methods, we reported that the oxidizationof cyt c is an early cytotoxicity marker prior to the release of cyt c. Moreover,as the spectral properties of ActD are sensitive to the surrounding environment, subcellular localization of ActD was visualized sensitively by the weakautofluorescence, and the intercalation of ActD into DNA was detected by shifted Raman peaks, allowing for parallel observation of drug uptake and the mechanismof action. In this research, we achieved simultaneous observation of cytotoxicityand cellular drug uptake by Raman microscopy, which could facilitate a preciseunderstanding of pharmacological effects and predict potential drug toxicity inthe future.

TI  - Formation of Cr-based layered double hydroxide: effect of the amendments.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-022-03557-9 [doi]
AB  - Chromium is one of the eight most popular inorganic soil pollutants in China, andits bioavailability is determined by the chemical states. Amendments, which areable to change the chemical forms of chromium and decrease its bioavailability,have received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, the formationof Cr-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and the immobilization of Cr insolution and soil were systemically investigated. The formation of Cr-based LDHs is strongly depended on the layer charges, aging temperatures and reaction time, as identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum. According to the potexperiment results, the concentration of Cr in the overground part of BrassicaChinensis L. was significantly decreased to 1.50-2.03 microg kg(- 1) in thepresent of amendments. In total, the finding of LDHs formation on amendments and the thermodynamic stability of LDHs provides a new insight into the remediationof Cr-polluted soils.

PG  - 2766-2776
LID - 10.1039/d2lc00377e [doi]
AB  - This study aimed at exploiting the so far unexploited potential of carrying outon-line sample pretreatment steps on microfluidic chips for single particleinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) measurements, anddemonstrating their ability to practically facilitate most of the simpler tasksinvolved in the spICP-MS analysis of nanoparticles. For this purpose,polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic chips, capable of high-range dilution andsample injection were made by casting, using high-precision, 3D-printed molds.Optimization of their geometry and functions was done by running severalhydrodynamic simulations and by gravimetric, fluorescence enhanced microscopeimaging and solution-based ICP-MS experiments. On the optimized microfluidicchips, several experiments were done, demonstrating the benefits of the approach and these devices, such as the determination of nanoparticle concentration using only a few tens of microliters of sample, elimination of solute interferences by dilution, solution-based size calibration and characterisation of binarynanoparticles. Due to the unique design of the chips, they can be linked togetherto extend the dilution range of the system by more than a magnitude per chip.This feature was also demonstrated in applications requiring multiple-magnitudedilution rates, when two chips were sequentially coupled.

PG  - 208-220
LID - 10.5607/en22011 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal sharp-wave ripple activity (SWRs) and the associated replay of neuralactivity patterns are well-known for their role in memory consolidation. Thisactivity has been studied using electrophysiological approaches, as high temporalresolution is required to recognize SWRs in the neuronal signals. However, it hasbeen difficult to analyze the individual contribution of neurons to task-specificSWRs, because it is hard to track neurons across a long time withelectrophysiological recording. In this study, we recorded local field potential (LFP) signals in the hippocampal CA1 of freely behaving mice and simultaneouslyimaged calcium signals in contralateral CA1 to leverage the advantages of bothelectrophysiological and imaging approaches. We manufactured a custom-designedmicrodrive array and targeted tetrodes to the left hippocampus CA1 for LFPrecording and applied electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampalcommissure (VHC) for closed-loop disruption of SWRs. Neuronal population imaging in the right hippocampal CA1 was performed using a miniature fluorescentmicroscope (Miniscope) and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. As SWRs show highly synchronized bilateral occurrence, calcium signals of SWR-participatingneurons could be identified and tracked in spontaneous or SWR-disruptedconditions. Using this approach, we identified a subpopulation of CA1 neuronsshowing synchronous calcium elevation to SWRs. Our results showed thatSWR-related calcium transients are more disrupted by electrical stimulation than non-SWRrelated calcium transients, validating the capability of the system todetect and disrupt SWRs. Our dual recording method can be used to uncover thedynamic participation of individual neurons in SWRs and replay over extended timewindows.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare microhardness and erosionsusceptibility of root dentine in teeth extracted from diabetic and non-diabetic donors after the application of different root canal irrigants. METHODS:Forty-eight single-rooted premolars with single canals (24 each from diabetic andnon-diabetic) were selected, and root canals were shaped by using rotary ProTaperfiles. Dentine slices of 4 mm were transversely sectioned from the middle rootthird. Specimens were assigned to four subgroups (n=6) and irrigated for 5minutes: 1) 2.6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); 2) 17% ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA); 3) 2% chlorhexidine (CHX); and 4) normal saline. Surfacemicrohardness was determined at 100- and 500-microm depths from the pulp-dentine interface. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the severity of dentine erosion. Data were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA, Post-hoc Tukey's, and Chi-square tests (P<0.05). RESULTS: Diabetes as well as NaOCl and EDTAdecreased surface microhardness of dentine significantly (P<0.05). Diabetes hadlittle effect on the erosion susceptibility of dentine (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Rootcanal irrigants can significantly lower the microhardness; specifically, indiabetic patients, and may be a factor affecting the longevity of rootcanal-treated teeth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the cleaning efficiency of XPFinisher (FKG Dentaire, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), XP Finisher R (FKGDentaire), and passive ultrasonic irrigation after root canal retreatment.METHODS: A total of 75 single-rooted human teeth were decoronated, instrumentedusing HyFlex EDM rotary files (Coltene/Whaledent Inc., Altstatten, Switzerland), and filled with gutta-percha and the TotalFill HiFlow bioceramic sealer (FKGDentaire) using the warm vertical compaction technique. Retreatment was performedwith D-Race rotary files (FKG Dentaire). Samples were randomly divided into five groups according to the activation protocol used. Samples were sectionedlongitudinally and prepared for the scanning electron microscope. The percentagesof cleaned canal walls in each third of the canal were determined using theImageJ software. The one-way ANOVA test was used to make comparisons among all ofthe tested groups, with a pairwise comparison made with the Bonferronicorrection. The significance level was set at P</=0.05. RESULTS: Results showedthat none of the activation techniques used resulted in complete canalcleanliness. However, XP Finisher R and XP Finisher had better cleaning abilitycompared with passive ultrasonic irrigation in all thirds of each root canal(P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The cleaning efficiency of XP Finisher R and XP Finisherwas superior to that of passive ultrasonic irrigation after the retreatment ofthe hydraulic calcium silicate sealer.

TI  - Lack of Correlation Between the Penetration of Two Types of Sealers andInterfacial Adaptation to Root Dentine.
PG  - 150-155
LID - 10.14744/eej.2022.06025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the correlation between sealerpenetration into dentinal tubules and interfacial adaptation to root canal walls using a hydraulic calcium silicate-based sealer, Endosequence Bioceramic Sealer(Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA, USA), and an epoxy resin-based sealer, AH Plus(Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany). METHODS: Sixty-four maxillary centralincisors were endodontically prepared with nickel-titanium rotary instruments andrandomly assigned into two groups (n=32). Roots were filled with gutta-perchausing a single-cone technique in conjunction with one of the two sealers, AHP or BCS. Sealers were mixed with Rhodamine B and analysed under a confocal laserscanning microscope. Transverse sections at 5 mm from root apex were obtained.The circumference of the root canal wall was first outlined and measured todetermine the circumferential percentage of sealer penetration. The regions alongthe canal walls where the sealer had penetrated the dentinal tubules weredelineated and measured. Then, the outlined distances were divided by the canalcircumference. The width of each gap was measured and pooled for each specimenfor comparison to determine the interfacial adaptation. The measurements wererepeated twice to ensure reproducibility. Mann-Whitney tests were performed tocompare continuous variables between AHP and BCS groups. The correlation between gap width and percentage of sealer penetration was investigated using theSpearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: No significant difference was observedbetween groups regarding the percentage of sealer penetration (P>0.05) and thegap width (P>0.05). Also, there was no significant correlation between the twovariables analysed for AHP (r=0.165; P>0.05) and BCS (r=-0.147; P>0.05) and inthe overall sample (r=0.061; P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The present results show nocorrelation between interfacial adaptation and sealer penetration in dentinaltubules in the total sample and among sealer subgroups. The ability of root canalsealers to penetrate dentinal tubules cannot be considered a sign of betterinterfacial adaptation.

AB  - Proteolytic enzymes and lipopeptides contain broad-spectrum antimicrobialactivities, which have great potential for research and development. A microbial strain X49 obtained from protease screening plate showed antifungal activitiesagainst six fungi. Biochemical analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing, API identification system, and electron microscope analysis were carried out to identify thebacterium. Azocasein method was used to analyze the protease activity.Lipopeptides were extracted for antifungal analysis. The result indicated thatstrain X49 grew in the range of 10-50 and pH 4.0-9.0. Moreover, it survived in10% NaCl, showing good halotolerance. Strain X49 was identified as Bacillusvelezensis. Genomic analysis of B. velezensis X49 revealed eleven genes encoding serine protease. The ID 1_894 belonging to S8 subtilisin family was 99% similarto the serine protease with known antifungal ability. On the other hand, thirtygenes encoding non-ribosomal peptide synthetase involved in the lipopeptidebiosynthesis, including surfactin, iturin, fengycin, bacitracin, and gramicidin, were identified. Part of the extracellular proteolytic activity remained underhigh temperature. After co-fermentation of B. velezensis X49 with Zingiberofficinale Rosc., the antifungal activity of the lipopeptide extract from theco-fermentation was greatly improved. In conclusion, B. velezensis X49 showedclear inhibitory effect on both plant and human pathogens. The active substances co-fermented with Chinese herbs and microbes can be utilized for further drugdevelopment.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.05.006 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: New fabrication techniques have been developed forremovable partial denture (RPD) frameworks although studies validating theclinical application of these techniques are scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of thisclinical study was to compare the adaptation of RPD framework rests made withconventional casting or computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing(CAD-CAM) with selective laser sintering (SLS) at the clinical evaluation and 1year after the delivery of the prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thistriple-blinded pilot study included 18 participants presenting with maxillaryand/or mandibular partial edentulism, of which only 7 returned for the secondmeasurement 1 year after prosthesis delivery. Participants were randomly assignedto 1 of 2 groups depending on whether the RPD framework was made with SLS orconventional lost-wax casting. The adaptation of the RPD at the rest seat areawas evaluated by injecting a silicone material on the abutment tooth beforeseating. The silicone specimens were then sectioned transversely and measuredwith a scanning electron microscope. The statistical analysis was performed with a linear mixed-effect model with the intention to treat and with a 3-factorrepeated measures ANOVA (alpha=.05). RESULTS: At the metal framework evaluation(T0), the prostheses made with SLS showed a mean +/-standard deviation adaptationof 398 +/-45 mum, while those made with conventional casting presented a mean+/-standard deviation adaptation of 176 +/-41 mum (P=.009). One year after thedelivery of the prostheses (T1), the adaptation of the frameworks made withconventional casting was still significantly better (88 +/-6 mum versus 197 +/-94mum, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Frameworks made with SLS showed worse clinical accuracyat the rest than frameworks produced with conventional casting.

AB  - This study was performed to estimate the corpse age using histologicalexaminations of the fourth and sixth ribs by a morphometric method. One hundredsamples of referred bodies of the Legal Medicine Organization of Lorestanprovince, Iran, were examined. The sampling was performed from the fourth andsixth ribs. The transverse sections of the samples were prepared, in whichvarious variables such as the diameter of the haversian system (DHC), haversiansystem perimeter (PHS), haversian system area (AHS), and the thickness of thehaversian lamellae (TH) were measured using a Motic microscope video system andthe Motic Image Plus 2 software. To predict age from sex and the morphometricparameters a stepwise multiple linear regression was used. Accordingly, AHS inrib 4, DHC with lens 10 in rib 4, DHC with lens 10 in rib 6 and TH in rib 6remained in the model at significance level 0.05 (R square = 0.1654). Althoughage was associated with some of the studied parameters, the obtained equation wasnot fit enough to predict the exact age. Further parameters should be studied forprediction of age in corpse.

AB  - Neodymium oxide exhibits a unique property, which facilitates and largelyutilized as an industrial applications. A number of cytotoxic study is available but very limited information is available to understand their biological activitywith neodymium oxide at a very low conc- entration of the material. The presentwork was designed to understand the cytotoxicity against liver (HepG-2) and lung (A-549) cancer cells. Initially, Neodymium oxides (Nd2O3) were prepared andcharacterized with various instruments. The crystallinity and morphology of Nd2O3powder were examined with instruments such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), scanningelectron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), EnergyDispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) respectively, revealed the size of curvednanostructure are ~140 +/- 2 in diameter whereas length goes upto ~700 nm withelemental composition. The cytotoxicity study was conducted with MTT, NRU assaywith genotoxicity study via ROS, cell cycle and qPCR analysis. The cellscytotoxic assessment were analysed via MTT(3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyl tetra zolium Bromide) and Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay withneodymium oxide (Nd2O3), which indicates the reduction in cell viability.Additionally, cell-cycle analysis showed an increase in the apoptotic peak after a 24-h. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) data revealed that apoptotic genessuch as p53, bax, and caspase-3 were up regulated, whereas bcl-2, ananti-apoptotic gene, was down regulated; therefore, apoptosis was mediatedthrough ROS and genotoxicity pathways. The experiments of cytotoxicity was testedand concludes that the Nd2O3 express a moderate and dose dependent effect oncancer cells. The ROS, cell cycle analysis and qPCR showed that Nd2O3 exhibit thecapability to cells death via ROS generation and genotoxicity study pathways.

TI  - Integrated analysis of multi-tissues lipidome and gut microbiome revealsmicrobiota-induced shifts on lipid metabolism in pigs.
PG  - 280-293

AB  - Lipid metabolism is very important for meat quality in pigs. Accumulatingevidence shows that gut microbiota can contribute to this physiological process. However, the gut microbiota that function in lipid metabolism and adipogenesisremains unclear. Here, we compared the characteristics of fat deposition and gut microbial community between Laiwu pigs and Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) (DLY)pigs. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to determine thepossible impact of gut microbiota on lipid metabolism in pigs. An integratedanalysis of the gut microbiome and lipidome of the small intestine, plasma, andliver was conducted to investigate the effects of FMT on host lipid metabolism.The comparative analysis of the gut microbiome showed higher abundance ofBacteroidetes (P = 0.0018) while lower abundance of Firmicutes (P = 0.012) inLaiwu pigs, and the microbial composition can be transferred from Laiwu pigs intoDLY pigs. Transmission electron microscope and Oil red-O staining were performed to analyze the effects of FMT on lipid deposition in liver, the main target organfor lipid metabolism. The results showed that FMT significantly increased thenumber of lipid droplets (P = 0.0035) and lipid accumulation (P = 0.0026) inliver. Furthermore, integrated multi-tissues lipidome analysis demonstrated that the fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids were significantly increased (P < 0.01) in intestine and liver, while glycerolipids and fatty acyls were reduced (P <0.01) in plasma. In the small intestine, FMT increased (P < 0.01) the relativeabundance of polyketides and prenol lipids but reduced (P < 0.01) thesaccharolipids. Correlation analysis revealed the potential interactions between microbiota and lipid metabolites. Together, our results indicated that the gutmicrobiota may regulate the lipid metabolism and enhance the accumulation oflipid droplets in the liver of pigs.

TI  - Urolithin A Attenuates Hyperuricemic Nephropathy in Fructose-Fed Mice byImpairing STING-NLRP3 Axis-Mediated Inflammatory Response via Restoration ofParkin-Dependent Mitophagy.
PG  - 907209
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.907209 [doi]
AB  - Urolithin A (UroA) is one of the primary intestinal metabolites of ellagitannins,showing translational potential as a nutritional intervention in humans. Mountingevidence suggests that fructose consumption contributes to the progression ofchronic kidney disease (CKD) that manifests in hyperuricemic nephropathy, renalinflammation, and tubulointerstitial injury. Here, we investigated the efficacyof UroA in alleviating fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy in mice. Uricacid-exposed human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were utilized for in vitro mechanismvalidation. Histopathological staining, immunoblotting, and transmission electronmicroscope were performed for the mechanistic investigations. Our resultsrevealed that UroA ameliorated fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy inmice. The histopathologic assessment showed that UroA attenuated tubularhypertrophy and dilation, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and collagendeposition in the kidney of fructose-fed mice. Mechanistically, UroA treatmentimpaired STING-NLRP3 activation, resulting in reduced production ofproinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Notably, UroA exhibited a scavenging effect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restoredfructose-impaired PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in nephropathic mice.Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of UroA in STING-NLRP3 activation was impairedafter Parkin gene silencing in HK-2 cells. Together, this study suggests thatUroA alleviates fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy by promotingParkin-dependent mitophagy, thereby suppressing STING-NLRP3 axis-mediatedinflammatory response. Thus, dietary supplementation with UroA orellagitannins-rich foods may serve as a promising intervention to prevent CKDprogression.

AB  - Single-cell proteomics has the potential to decipher tumor heterogeneity, and amethod like single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) allowsprofiling several tens of single cells for >1,000 proteins per cell. This method,however, cannot link the proteome of individual cells with phenotypes ofinterest. Here, we developed a microscopy-based functional single-cellproteomic-profiling technology, called FUNpro, to address this. FUNpro enablesscreening, identification, and isolation of single cells of interest in areal-time fashion, even if the phenotypes are dynamic or the cells of interestare rare. We applied FUNpro to proteomically profile a newly identified smallsubpopulation of U2OS osteosarcoma cells displaying an abnormal, prolonged DNAdamage response (DDR) after ionizing radiation (IR). With this, we identified thePDS5A protein contributing to the abnormal DDR dynamics and helping the cellssurvive after IR.

AB  - Background: We attempt to discuss the function of self-made prescription compoundRhodiola rosea on the kidneys of rats with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN),through studying the effects of self-made rescription compound Rhodiola rosea on the ultrastructure of podocytes in rats with DN. Methods: DN rat model wasestablished by streptozotocin. The successfully modeled rats were divided into 4 groups, DN group, compound Rhodiola low-dose group, medium-dose group, andhigh-dose group. Compound Rhodiola low-dose group, medium-dose group, andhigh-dose group were administered for 8 weeks, and the DN group and the blankcontrol group were administered with normal saline. The podocyte count, podocyte width, podocyte fusion rate, and average thickness of glomerular basementmembrane were compared in each group, and the ultrastructural changes inpodocytes were observed by transmission electron microscope. Results: Comparedwith the normal control group, the number of podocytes in the DN group remarkablyreduced, but the width level of podocyte, the fusion rate of podocyte, and theaverage thickness of basilar membrane remarkably increased (P < 0.05). Comparedwith the DN group, the number of podocytes in the high-, medium-, and low-dosegroups increased remarkably, but the width level of podocyte, the fusion rate of podocyte, and the average thickness of basilar membrane decreased remarkably (P <0.05). Compared with the low-dose group, the number of podocytes in the high-dosegroup and the medium-dose group increased remarkably, but the width of podocyte, the fusion rate of podocyte, as well as the average thickness of basilar membraneremarkably reduced (P < 0.05). Various indicators of high- and medium-dose groupshad no statistical difference (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Self-made prescriptioncompound Rhodiola rosea can promote the recovery of podocyte in DN rat andprotect their kidney.

LID - 10.1002/bco2.137 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To propose a point-of-care image recognition system for kidney stone composition classification using smartphone microscopy and deep convolutionalneural networks. Materials and methods: A total of 37 surgically extracted human kidney stones consisting of calcium oxalate (CaOx), cystine, uric acid (UA) andstruvite stones were included in the study. All of the stones were fragmentedfrom percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The stones were classified usingFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis before obtainingsmartphone microscope images. The size of the stones ranged from 5 to 10 mm indiameter. Nurugo 400x smartphone microscope (Nurugo, Seoul, Republic of Korea)was functionalized to acquire microscopic images (magnification = 25x) of drykidney stones using iPhone 6s+ (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA). Each kidney stone wasimaged in six different locations. In total, 222 images were captured from 37stones. A novel convolutional neural network architecture was built forclassification, and the model was assessed using accuracy, positive predictivevalue, sensitivity and F1 scores. Results: We achieved an overall and weightedaccuracy of 88% and 87%, respectively, with an average F1 score of 0.84. Thepositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score for each stone type wererespectively reported as follows: CaOx (0.82, 0.83, 0.82), cystine (0.80, 0.88,0.84), UA (0.92, 0.77, 0.85) and struvite (0.86, 0.84, 0.85). Conclusion: Wedemonstrate a rapid and accurate point of care diagnostics method for classifyingthe four types of kidney stones. In the future, diagnostic tools that combinesmartphone microscopy with artificial intelligence (AI) can provide accessiblehealth care that can support physicians in their decision-making process.

TI  - Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Lipid Metabolism in Rats With NAFLD.
PG  - 901827

AB  - This work aimed to study the intervention effect of exercise on lipid metabolism in NAFLD rats, provide a more scientific experimental basis for exploring andimproving the theoretical system of exercise intervention in NAFLD, and furtherprovide a theoretical research basis for clinical treatment of NAFLD. Fortyhealthy male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into a blank control group(BC,14) and a model group (MO, 26). After 6 degrees weeks of modeling, the MOgroup was randomly divided into the model control group (MC, 12) and the aerobic exercise group (AE, 12). Platform running intervention in group E was conductedat a slope of 0 degrees , a speed of 15 m/min, 1 h/time, once a day, six times a week, and a day of rest, for 8 degrees weeks in total. After the intervention,the liver tissues of rats were taken for pathological sections, and serum wastaken and analyzed for TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, and FFA levels. Under the lightmicroscope, the liver tissue structure of rats in the BC group was complete andclear, the structure of liver lobules was clear and normal, the volume ofhepatocytes was uniform, the nucleus was in the middle, and the cytoplasm wasred-stained, and no steatosis of hepatocytes was found. The liver of rats in the MC group showed diffuse fatty lesions, disordered structure of hepatic lobules,disordered arrangement of hepatic cords, different sizes of hepatocytes, loosecytoplasm, and diffuse lipid droplets of different sizes in the cytoplasm. Theaccumulation of liver lipid droplets in the AE group was improved compared withthe MC group, the number of fat vacuoles in hepatocytes was significantlyreduced, and the degree of liver lipid deposition was reduced. Compared with the BC group, the content of TC, TG, LDL-C, and FFA in the serum of the MC groupincreased significantly (p < 0.01), and the content of HDL-C decreasedsignificantly (p < 0.01). Compared with the MC group, the content of TC, TG,LDL-C, and FFA in the serum of the AE group decreased significantly (p < 0.01/p <0.05), and the content of HDL-C increased significantly (p < 0.01). Therefore,moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has an intervention effect on lipidmetabolism in NAFLD rats, which can be used as one of the means to treat NAFLD.

TI  - Optimal Sacrificial Domains in Mechanical Polyproteins: S. epidermidis AdhesinsAre Tuned for Work Dissipation.
PG  - 1417-1427
LID - 10.1021/jacsau.2c00121 [doi]
AB  - The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis utilizes a multidomainsurface adhesin protein to bind host components and adhere to tissues. While itis known that the interaction between the SdrG receptor and its fibrinopeptidetarget (FgB) is exceptionally mechanostable ( approximately 2 nN), the influence of downstream B domains (B1 and B2) is unclear. Here, we studied the mechanicalrelationships between folded B domains and the SdrG receptor bound to FgB. Weused protein engineering, single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) with anatomic force microscope (AFM), and Monte Carlo simulations to understand how the mechanical properties of folded sacrificial domains, in general, can be optimallytuned to match the stability of a receptor-ligand complex. Analogous tomacroscopic suspension systems, sacrificial shock absorber domains should neitherbe too weak nor too strong to optimally dissipate mechanical energy. We builtartificial molecular shock absorber systems based on the nanobody (VHH) scaffold and studied the competition between domain unfolding and receptor unbinding. Wequantitatively determined the optimal stability of shock absorbers that maximizeswork dissipation on average for a given receptor and found that naturalsacrificial domains from pathogenic S. epidermidis and Clostridium perfringensadhesins exhibit stabilities at or near this optimum within a specific range ofloading rates. These findings demonstrate how tuning the stability of sacrificialdomains in adhesive polyproteins can be used to maximize mechanical workdissipation and serve as an adhesion strategy by bacteria.

TI  - Thicker Ice Improves the Integrity and Angular Distribution of CDC48A Hexamers onCryo-EM Grids.
PG  - 890390
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.890390 [doi]
AB  - Many cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analyses areconstrained by the sample preparation step upon which aggregation, dissociation, and/or preferential orientation of particles can be introduced. Here, we reporthow we solved these problems in the case of CDC48A, a hexameric AAA ATPase fromArabidopsis thaliana. CDC48A hexamers are well preserved under negative staining conditions but disassemble during grid freezing using the classical blottingmethod. Vitrification of grids using the blot-free Chameleon method preserved theintegrity of particles but resulted in their strong preferential orientation. We then used a strategy where we improved in parallel the purification of CDC48A andthe conditions for cryo-EM data acquisition. Indeed, we noted that images takenfrom thicker ice presented an even distribution of intact particles with randomorientations, but resulted in a lower image resolution. Consequently, in ourcase, distribution, orientation, image resolution, and the integrity of particleswere tightly correlated with ice thickness. By combining the more homogeneous andstable CDC48A hexamers resulting from our improved purification protocol with an iterative search across different ice thicknesses, we identified an intermediate thickness that retained sufficiently high-resolution structural information whilemaintaining a complete distribution of particle orientations. Our approach mayprovide a simple, fast, and generally applicable strategy to record data ofsufficient quality under standard laboratory and microscope settings. This methodmay be of particular value when time and resources are limited.

PG  - 3275-3294
LID - 10.1364/BOE.451634 [doi]
AB  - High-NA light sheet illumination can improve the resolution of single-moleculelocalization microscopy (SMLM) by reducing the background fluorescence. Theseapproaches currently require custom-made sample holders or additional specializedobjectives, which makes the sample mounting or the optical system complex andtherefore reduces the usability of these approaches. Here, we developed asingle-objective lens-inclined light sheet microscope (SOLEIL) that is capable of2D and 3D SMLM in thick samples. SOLEIL combines oblique illumination with point spread function PSF engineering to enable dSTORM imaging in a wide variety ofsamples. SOLEIL is compatible with standard sample holders and off-the-shelveoptics and standard high NA objectives. To accomplish optimal optical sectioning we show that there is an ideal oblique angle and sheet thickness. Furthermore, toshow what optical sectioning delivers for SMLM we benchmark SOLEIL againstwidefield and HILO microscopy with several biological samples. SOLEIL delivers in15 mum thick Caco2-BBE cells a 374% higher intensity to background ratio and a54% improvement in the estimated CRLB compared to widefield illumination, and a184% higher intensity to background ratio and a 20% improvement in the estimated CRLB compared to HILO illumination.

TI  - Deep learning for denoising in a Mueller matrix microscope.
PG  - 3535-3551
LID - 10.1364/BOE.457219 [doi]
AB  - The Mueller matrix microscope is a powerful tool for characterizing themicrostructural features of a complex biological sample. Performance of a Muellermatrix microscope usually relies on two major specifications: measurementaccuracy and acquisition time, which may conflict with each other but bothcontribute to the complexity and expenses of the apparatus. In this paper, wereport a learning-based method to improve both specifications of a Mueller matrixmicroscope using a rotating polarizer and a rotating waveplate polarization stategenerator. Low noise data from long acquisition time are used as the groundtruth. A modified U-Net structured network incorporating channel attentioneffectively reduces the noise in lower quality Mueller matrix images obtainedwith much shorter acquisition time. The experimental results show that using highquality Mueller matrix data as ground truth, such a learning-based method canachieve both high measurement accuracy and short acquisition time in polarizationimaging.

AB  - Coronavirus is a type of single-stranded RNA virus with a lipid bilayer called anenvelope on the outside, and it looks like a corona under an electron microscope.It cannot self-regenerate, attaches to and enters human cells via ACE2 receptors,and proliferates within the human cells. There have been some coronaviraldiseases such as SARS, MERS and "normal" human coronaviruses (HCoV) that causecommon colds. The "new coronavirus" was named as SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),and new coronavirus infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19short for "corona-virus disease discovered in 2019". SARS-CoV-2 infection spreadsbefore the symptom onset, and prophylactic actions such as wearing masks andsocial or physical distancing are very important and critical. Treatment ofCOVID-19 is mainly performed by appropriately combining respiratory management,neutralizing antibody drugs, antiviral drugs, corticosteroids (dexamethasone,prednisolone, etc.), immunomodulators (baricitinib, tocilizumab), anticoagulants (heparin, etc.), and antibacterial drugs, and treatment of comorbidities is also performed in parallel.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Qmix as Endodontic Irrigant on Reversal of BondStrength in Teeth Subjected to Irradiation: An Scanning Electron MicroscopeStudy.
PG  - 331-336
AB  - AIM: The aim of this current study was to compare and evaluate the reversalefficacy of Qmix and chitosan-based irrigation materials quantitatively throughthe assessment of the push-out bond strength of bioceramic sealer employinguniversal testing machine and to qualitatively analyze the sealer/dentininterface by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the teeth subjected tofractioned radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety single-rooted straight human maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into six groups (n = 15) wherein three groups comprise Chitosan, Qmix, and EDTA/sodium hypochlorite which were not exposed to irradiation while other three groups were challenged withirradiation protocols. Root canals were prepared with ProTaper universal systemand all the samples were irrigated according to the final irrigation protocolsand obturated with bioceramic sealers. Dentin slices were prepared with 1 mmthickness from each root third for the estimation of bond strength of sealers to dentin. Qualitative assessment of the sealer-dentin interface was done byscanning electron microscopy. Bond strength data were scrutinized by independent t-test and failure modes using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: Significantly lower bond strength (p <0.05) was recorded after irradiation compared withnonirradiated group. To quantify the results irrigation protocols, Qmix hadhighest bond strength followed by chitosan and EDTA/sodium hypochlorite groupirrespective of irradiation status. Bond strength values reduced afterirradiation in all root thirds irrespective of the irrigation materials. Scanningelectron microscope images revealed traces of repair process for Qmix-basedirrigation materials than the chitosan-based materials for both irradiated andnonirradiated specimens. CONCLUSION: All the irrigation materials employed inthis study had good bond strength. The specimen irrigated with Qmix hadcomparatively higher bond strength than the chitosan-based materials. The teethsubjected to irradiation challenge were associated with a decrease in thepush-out bond strength of sealers to intraradicular dentin with formation of moregaps and fewer tags at the sealer/dentin interface. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:Selection of ideal irrigation protocols still remains a challenge for theclinical practitioners, and this study explored the utilization of novelmaterials used for irrigation, especially in the teeth subjected to radiation.

AB  - Digitalisation of pathology slides allows pathologists to make diagnoses using a high-resolution computer screen instead of a conventional microscope. In 2020/21,the four pathology departments in the Region of Southern Denmark implementeddigital pathology for all histologic samples. Going digital necessitatedoptimisation of workflows and training of pathologists, avoiding a reduction indiagnostic quality. This review describes the process for realisation of digital pathology and its future perspectives, including artificial intelligencealgorithms to be implemented.

TI  - Real Time and Repeated Measurement of Skeletal Muscle Growth in Individual LiveZebrafish Subjected to Altered Electrical Activity.
LID - 10.3791/64063 [doi]
AB  - A number of methods can be used to visualize individual cells throughout the bodyof live embryonic, larval or juvenile zebrafish. We show that live fish withfluorescently-marked plasma membranes can be scanned in a confocal laser scanningmicroscope in order to determine the volume of muscle tissue and the number ofmuscle fibers present. Efficient approaches for the measurement of cell numberand size in live animals over time are described and validated against morearduous segmentation methods. Methods are described that permit the control ofmuscle electrical, and thus contractile, activity. Loss of skeletal musclecontractile activity greatly reduced muscle growth. In larvae, a protocol isdescribed that allows reintroduction of patterned electrical-evoked contractileactivity. The described methods minimize the effect of inter-individualvariability and will permit analysis of the effect of electrical, genetic, drug, or environmental stimuli on a variety of cellular and physiological growthparameters in the context of the living organism. Long-term follow-up of themeasured effects of a defined early-life intervention on individuals cansubsequently be performed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the ability of a borate adhesive to protectenamel/dentin surfaces from acidic erosion and its effect on the shear bondstrength (SBS) of enamel/dentin to resin composite. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 180human enamel/dentin specimens were utilized. Enamel buccal surfaces were etchedwith phosphoric-acid then divided into: (EBG) borate glass adhesive group; (ERS) resin-adhesive system group; (EF) fluoride gel 1.23% group, and enamel control(EC) group; followed by bonding to orthodontic-buttons. The dentin specimens wereconditioned by EDTA (Ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) and divided into: (DBG) borate glass resin, (DRS) resin adhesive; (DDA) group had a dentin-desensitizing agent VivaSens (VivaDent, Liechtenstein) and (DC) control group. The treatedenamel/dentin specimens had their SBS to composite. The enamel/dentin specimenswere exposed to 1% citric acid (18 min). Enamel/dentin specimens were examined by(SEM/EDS) scanning-electron-microscope equipped withelectron-dispersive-spectroscopy and (FTIR/ATR). Analysis-of-Variance (ANOVA) wasused to compare the SBS and Wilcoxon-signed-rank test was used to compare theenamel/dentin areas protected by the applied agents before/after erosion (p =0.05). RESULTS: There was no significance difference in SBS among all groupsexcept for (DDA) group that showed significant decrease p < 0.05. (EBG) and (DBG)groups were the only groups significantly protected enamel and dentin fromerosion p < 0.05. FTIR/ATR showed that erosion altered the chemical structure of (DRS), (DDA), and (DC) groups but did not affect the other enamel/dentin groups. Degree of conversion of the borate-adhesive system was acceptable. CONCLUSION:The Borate adhesive system released calcium and phosphate compounds thatdecreased the erosive activity of the citric acid resulting in protectingsimulated dentin-hypersensitive areas and enamel from erosion without affectingthe SBS to resin-composite. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A Borate adhesive system canbe adopted as a therapeutic agent in a fully integrated program for protectingdentin-hypersensitive areas and in enamel next to orthodontic fixed appliances.

LID - 10.1002/smll.202202065 [doi]
AB  - Biomaterials with outstanding mechanical properties, including spider silk, wood,and cartilage, often feature an oriented nanofibrillar structure. The orientationof nanofibrils gives rise to a significant mechanical anisotropy, which isextremely challenging to characterize, especially for microscopically small orinhomogeneous samples. Here, a technique utilizing atomic force microscopeindentation at multiple points combined with finite element analysis to samplethe mechanical anisotropy of a thin film in a microscopically small area isreported. The system studied here is the tape-like silk of the Chilean reclusespider, which entirely consists of strictly oriented nanofibrils giving rise to alarge mechanical anisotropy. The most detailed directional nanoscalestructure-property characterization of spider silk to date is presented,revealing the tensile and transverse elastic moduli as 9 and 1 GPa, respectively,and the binding strength between silk nanofibrils as 159 +/- 13 MPa. Furthermore,based on this binding strength, the nanofibrils' surface energy is derived as 37 mJ m(-2) , and concludes that van der Waals forces play a decisive role ininterfibrillar binding. Due to its versatility, this technique has many potentialapplications, including early disease diagnostics, as underlying pathologicalconditions can alter the local mechanical properties of tissues.

AB  - The illustrations of Hashime Murayama were vital in enabling the Papanicolaoutest to be understood, admired and observed worldwide, making Papanicolaou'sAtlas of cytology so fundamental in the detection and prevention of cervicalcancer. Murayama was a talented Japanese artist who initially worked for theNational Geographic magazine; his figurative watercolours were ideal forportraying the wonders of nature. Later, he collaborated with George Papanicolaouin Cornell University as he was able to improve on the microphotography of theera; an era in which it was not yet understood why cervical cancer caused so manydeaths. His illustrations captured the most intricate cellular details and hisartistic legacy will always be enlightening in each display of cellular artistry as seen under the microscope.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Raman microscopic spectroscopyis a new approach for furthercharacterization and detection of molecular features in many pathologicalprocesses. This technique has been successfully applied to scrutinize the spatialdistribution of small molecules and proteins within biological systems by in situanalysis. This study uses Raman microscopic spectroscopyto identify any in-depth benefits and drawbacks in diagnosing Staphylococcus epidermidis in human bonegrafts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40 non-infected human bone samples and 10 humanbone samples infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis were analyzed using Ramanmicroscopic spectroscopy. Reflectance data were collected between 200 cm(-1) and 3600 cm(-1) with a spectral resolution of 4 cm(-1) using a Senterra II microscope(Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). The acquired spectral information was used forspectral and unsupervised classification, such as principal component analysis.RESULTS: Raman measurements produced distinct diagnostic spectra that were usedto distinguish between non-infected human bone samples and Staphylococcusepidermidis infected human bone samples by spectral and principal componentanalyses. A substantial loss in bone quality and protein conformation wasdetected by human bone samples co-cultured with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Themineral-to-matrix ratio using the phosphate/Amide I ratio (p = 0.030) andcarbonate/phosphate ratio (p = 0.001) indicates that the loss of relative mineralcontent in bones upon bacterial infection is higher than in non-infected humanbones. Also, an increase of alterations in the collagen network (p = 0.048) and adecrease in the structural organization and relative collagen in infected humanbone could be detected. Subsequent principal component analyses identifiedStaphylococcus epidermidis in different spectral regions, respectively,originating mainly from CH2 deformation (wagging) of protein (at 1450 cm(-1)) andbending and stretching modes of C-H groups ( approximately 2800-3000 cm(-1)).CONCLUSION: Raman microscopic spectroscopyis presented as a promising diagnostic tool to detect Staphylococcus epidermidis in human bone grafts. Further studiesin human tissues are warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endothelial glycocalyx is a carbohydrate-rich layer lining theluminal side of blood vessels. Its damage was demonstrated in different groups ofcritically ill patients. Indirect evidence showed that endothelial glycocalyxdegradation might be an important factor in pathophysiology of preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to demonstrate endothelial glycocalyx by transmissionelectron microscopy and to compare its amount in the omentum vessels of pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia and two control groups. METHODS: Patients with severe preeclampsia who had a cesarean section were included in the study.Controls were healthy pregnant people at term with an elective cesarean sectionand non-pregnant patients of reproductive age who underwent laparoscopy forbenign conditions. We performed omentum biopsies in all three groups. Sampleswere prepared for transmission electron microscopy using perfusion with rutheniumred. We measured the amount of endothelial glycocalyx attached to apical plasmamembrane of endothelial cells as the area of glycocalyx observed withtransmission electron microscope. RESULTS: In the analysis we included ninepatients from each group and demonstrated statistically significant difference inthe amount of endothelial glycocalyx among the three groups (p = 0.018).Glycocalyx was significantly reduced in severe preeclampsia (median 1.90 mum(2), interquartile range 0.80-4.1 mum(2)) compared to non-pregnant controls (median14.34 mum(2), interquartile range 3.80-73.32 mum(2)); p = 0.021. A trend towards reduced glycocalyx amount in preeclampsia vs. pregnant controls and pregnantcontrols vs. non-pregnant controls was observed but without statisticalsignificance. DISCUSSION: Compared to non-pregnant controls the endothelialglycocalyx was significantly reduced in pregnant patients with severepreeclampsia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poly(3-caprolactone) (PCL)/beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)composite scaffolds fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing are one of the common scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration. However, the main challenge ofthese 3D printed PCL/beta-TCP scaffolds is the fact that many cells pass fromporosities during in vitro cell seeding, leading to poor initial cell attachment.This study aimed to demonstrate the fabrication of a new collagen coating processfor optimizing the hydrophilic property and cell-substrate interactions. Thismethod may be used for coating collagen on any relevant biomedical constructsmade of synthetic polymers to increase their biocompatibility and cellattachment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porous composite scaffolds fabricated by 3Dprinting were coated with collagen by a novel method and compared to traditional methods. After plasma treatment, samples were inverted in a homogenized collagen solution, freeze-dried, stabilized by crosslinking, freeze-dried again, andfibrillated using a defined salt concentration. Samples were characterized by a3D laser microscope, cytocompatibility assay, attenuated total reflectanceFourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, water absorption, proteinabsorption, and bioactivity assay. RESULTS: Homogenized collagen at pH= 7resulted in a very uniform layer on the surface of scaffolds with significantlyhigher cell proliferation (p < 0.05). Collagen-coated scaffolds showedsignificantly higher water absorption, protein absorption, and bioactivitycompared to non-coated samples (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results demonstratethat both the pH and collagen structure influence the coating of scaffolds, whilethe concentrations used in this study do not have a significant difference inthis aspect. The combination of homogenization and fibrillization makes scaffoldsmore biocompatible and desirable for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - X-ray microscopes adopting computed tomography (CT) enable nondestructive 3Dvisualization of biological specimens at micron-level resolution withoutconventional 2D serial sectioning that is a destructive/laborious method and isroutinely used for analyzing renal biopsy in clinical diagnosis of kidneydiseases. Here we applied a compact commercial system of laboratory-based X-raymicroscope to observe a resin-embedded osmium-stained 1 mm strip of a mousekidney piece as a model of renal biopsy, toward more efficient diagnosis ofkidney diseases. A reconstructed CT image from several hours of data collectionusing CCD detector allowed us to unambiguously segment a single nephron connectedto a renal corpuscle, which was consistent with previous reports using serialsectioning. Histogram analysis on the segmented nephron confirmed that theproximal and distal tubules were distinguishable on the basis of their X-rayopacities. A 3D rendering model of the segmented nephron visualized a convoluted structure of renal tubules neighboring the renal corpuscle and a branchedstructure of efferent arterioles. Furthermore, another data collection usingsCMOS detector with much shorter data acquisition time of 15 min provided similarresults from the same samples. These results suggest a potential application ofthe compact laboratory-based X-ray microscope to analyze mouse renal biopsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Luteolin, a flavonoid compound with anti-inflammatory activity, hasbeen reported to alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However,its potential mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: The binding activity ofluteolin to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) wascalculated via molecular docking analysis. Rats were subjected to middle cerebralartery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). After reperfusion, vehicle, 25 mg/kg/dluteolin, 50 mg/kg/d luteolin, 10 mg/kg/d pioglitazone, 50 mg/kg/d luteolincombined with 10 mg/kg/d T0070907 (PPARgamma inhibitor) were immediately orallytreatment for 7 days. ELISA, TTC staining, H&E staining, immunohistochemistry,immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscope methods were performed toevaluate the inflammation and autophagy in damaged hippocampal region. ThePPARgamma, light chain 3 (LC3) B-II/LC3B-I and p-nuclear factor-kappaB(NF-kappaB) p65 proteins expression levels in damaged hippocampal region wereanalyzed. RESULTS: Luteolin showed good PPARgamma activity according to dockingscore (score = - 8.2). Luteolin treatment downregulated the infarct area and the pro-inflammatory cytokines levels caused by MCAO/R injury. Moreover, luteolinadministration ameliorated neuroinflammation and autophagy in damaged hippocampalregion. Pioglitazone plays protective roles similar to luteolin. T0070907concealed the neuroprotective roles of 50 mg/kg/d luteolin. CONCLUSIONS: Luteolinexerts neuroprotective roles against inflammation and autophagy of hippocampusinduced by cerebral I/R by activating PPARgamma in rats.

AB  - Owing to the high resolution of magnetic force microscopes (MFMs) operating atlow temperatures and high-applied magnetic fields, they can be employed to study various phenomena observed in topological magnetic materials and superconductors.In this study, we constructed a low-temperature MFM equipped with a 2-2-9-Tvector magnet and a three-axis fiber-optic alignment system. The three-axisalignment device enables in situ calibration of the scanner at low temperaturesas well as optimizes the intensity and sensitivity of the interferometer signal. A massive homebuilt vibration isolation table lowers the resonance frequency ofthe system and minimizes mechanical noise. Consequently, the minimum detectableforce gradient of our proposed model is close to the thermodynamic limit of thecantilever. To demonstrate the low-temperature capability of the MFM, we obtainedmagnetic domain images of the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe4GeTe2 and theAbrikosov superconducting vortices of an Nb film. Furthermore, we performed fieldangle-dependent MFM experiments in a van der Waals magnetic insulator Cr2Ge2Te6to verify its vector-field functionality and observed a transition in the domainsfrom the stripe to the bubble phase with respect to the magnetic field angle. Thevector-field capability of our MFM can be useful for investigating variousanisotropic magnetic phenomena in topological magnetic and superconductingmaterials.

TI  - Overexpressed LINC01510 Attenuates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in HighGlucose-Induced Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells via Inactivating MMP7.
PG  - 367-373
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) can promote renal fibrosis indiabetic kidney disease (DKD). A study found that LINC01510 overexpressioninhibits MMP7 to play a role in renal cancer, but the relationship between thetwo in DKD had not been revealed, and the function of LINC01510 also needed to beexplored, which was also the focus of this study. METHODS: The morphologicalchanges of HK-2 cells induced by high glucose were observed by an invertedmicroscope, and fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine thesubcellular localization of LINC01510. Quantitative realtime polymerase chainreaction was used to detect the levels of LINC01510 and MMP7. The effect ofLINC01510 and MMP7 overexpression on high glucose-induced HK-2 cell migration andepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein changes was confirmed by wound healing experiments and western blot. RESULTS: High glucose induced HK-2cells to gradually lose their epithelial phenotype, and decreased LINC01510 in a time-dependent manner. LINC01510 was located in the nucleus of HK-2 cells.LINC01510 overexpression increased the level of LINC01510, inhibited cellmigration, and reduced the expression of MMP-7, Vimentin, alpha-SMA, andFibronectin protein, and promoted the expression of E-cadherin protein in highglucose-induced cells. The effect of MMP7 overexpression on migration andEMT-related proteins was opposite to the effect of LINC01510 overexpression, and partially reversed the effect of LINC01510 overexpression in high glucose-inducedcells. CONCLUSION: Our research shows that LINC01510 overexpression inactivatesMMP7 to attenuate high glucose-induced EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells.

AB  - Currently, it is still a huge challenge to prepare high performance eco-friendly poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with high thermal stability, good processability,excellent crystallization behavior, good transparency and highly-efficient firesafety. In this paper, a novel bio-based nucleation agentN-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-P,P-diphenylphosphinic amide (FPPA) was prepared and usedfor the fabrication of fire safety PLA/FPPA composites. The chemical structure ofFPPA was measured by FTIR, NMR and MS. Further, the crystallization behavior,thermal stability, fire safety and mechanical properties of PLA/FPPA compositeswere performed by TGA, DSC, polarization microscope, LOI, UL94, cone calorimeter,DMA and, SEM, Raman, GC-MS, and TGA-FTIR. The results showed that themultifunctional FPPA not only had a high thermal stability and was a goodnucleation agent for PLA. Moreover, only loading of 3 wt% FPPA increased the LOI of PLA from 19.0 to 33.8 % with UL-94 V-0 classification. Furthermore, the heatrelease rate and total heat release values of PLA/3%FPPA composite reduced by 6.3% and 15.3 % in cone-calorimeter test. Such high fire safety was mainlyattributed to specific fire safety radicals due to thermal degradation of FPPA tointerrupt composites burning in gas phase. Besides, transparency and mechanicalproperties were almost not changed because of low loading of FPPA in PLA. Thismultifunctional bio-based fire-retardant for PLA with good comprehensiveperformance promises broad application in engineering electronics, automobiles,3D printing and construction materials.

TI  - Heat Transfer-Inspired Network for Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3185529 [doi]
AB  - Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical image preprocessing task for manyapplications. How to recover features as accurately as possible is the focus ofSR algorithms. Most existing SR methods tend to guide the image reconstructionprocess with gradient maps, frequency perception modules, etc. and improve thequality of recovered images from the perspective of enhancing edges, but rarelyoptimize the neural network structure from the system level. In this article, we conduct an in-depth exploration for the inner nature of the SR network structure.In light of the consistency between thermal particles in the thermal field andpixels in the image domain, we propose a novel heat-transfer-inspired network(HTI-Net) for image SR reconstruction based on the theoretical basis of heattransfer. With the finite difference theory, we use a second-ordermixed-difference equation to redesign the residual network (ResNet), which canfully integrate multiple information to achieve better feature reuse. Inaddition, according to the thermal conduction differential equation (TCDE) in thethermal field, the pixel value flow equation (PVFE) in the image domain isderived to mine deep potential feature information. The experimental results onmultiple standard databases demonstrate that the proposed HTI-Net has superioredge detail reconstruction effect and parameter performance compared with theexisting SR methods. The experimental results on the microscope chip image (MCI) database consisting of realistic low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR)images show that the proposed HTI-Net for image SR reconstruction can improve theeffectiveness of the hardware Trojan detection system.

PG  - 3363-3366
LID - 10.1364/OL.463350 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate band flip in one-dimensional dielectric photonic latticespresenting numerical and experimental results. In periodic optical latticessupporting leaky Bloch modes, there exists a second stop band where one band edgeexperiences radiation loss resulting in guided-mode resonance (GMR), while theother band edge becomes a nonleaky bound state in the continuum (BIC). Toillustrate the band flip, band structures for two different lattices are providedby calculating zero-order reflectance with respect to wavelength and incidentangle. We then provide three photonic lattices, each with a different fillfactor, consisting of photoresist gratings on Si3N4 sublayers with glasssubstrates. The designs are fabricated using laser interferometric lithography.The lattice parameters are characterized and verified with an atomic forcemicroscope. The band transition under fill-factor variation is accomplishedexperimentally. The measured data are compared to simulation results and showgood agreement.

TI  - Mapping Shear Bands in Metallic Glasses: From Atomic Structure to Bulk Dynamics.
PG  - 245501
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.245501 [doi]
AB  - A deep understanding of the mechanisms controlling shear banding is offundamental importance for improving the mechanical properties of metallicglasses. Atomistic simulations highlight the importance of nanoscale stresses andstrains for shear banding, but corresponding experimental proofs are scarce dueto limited characterization techniques. Here, by using precession nanodiffractionmapping in the transmission electron microscope, the atomic density and straindistribution of an individual shear band is quantitatively mapped at 2 nmresolution. We demonstrate that shear bands exhibit density alternation from the atomic scale to the submicron scale and complex strain fields exist, causingshear band segmentation and deflection. The atomic scale density alternationreveals the autocatalytic generation of shear transformation zones, while thedensity alternation at submicron scale results from the progressive propagationof shear band front and extends to the surrounding matrix, forming oval highlystrained regions with density consistently higher ( approximately 0.2%) than the encapsulated shear band segments. Through combination with molecular dynamicsimulations, a complete picture for shear band formation and propagation isestablished.

AB  - Tomographic reconstruction of frozen-hydrated specimens followed by extractionand averaging of sub-tomograms has successfully been used to determine thestructure of macromolecules in their native environment at resolutions that arehigh enough to reveal molecular level interactions. The low throughputcharacteristic of tomographic data acquisition combined with the complexdata-analysis pipeline that is required to obtain high-resolution maps, however, has limited the applicability of this technique to favorable samples or toresolutions that are too low to provide useful mechanistic information. Recently,beam image-shift electron cryo-tomography (BISECT), a strategy to significantlyaccelerate the acquisition of tilt series without sacrificing image quality, was introduced. The ability to produce thousands of high-quality tilt series during asingle microscope session, however, introduces significant bottlenecks in thedownstream data analysis, which has so far relied on specialized pipelines. Here,recent advances in accurate estimation of the contrast transfer function andself-tuning exposure-weighting routines that contribute to improving theresolution and streamlining the structure-determination process using sub-volume averaging are reviewed. Ultimately, the combination of automated data-driventechniques for image analysis together with high-throughput strategies fortilt-series acquisition will pave the way for tomography to become the technique of choice for in situ structure determination.
