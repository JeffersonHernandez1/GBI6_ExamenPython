TI  - Evaluation of Celiac Disease by Minimally Invasive Biomarkers in a SpanishPediatric Population.
LID - 5020 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19095020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) has been substantially improved with the availability of highly sensitive CD-specific IgA-TG2, Ig-GDP, andIgA-EMA. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, andNutrition (ESPGHAN) published (2012) and updated (2020) diagnostic criteria forCD in order to simplify CD diagnosis and to avoid biopsies in selected patients. METHODS: A prospective study including 5641 pediatric patients (0-16 years old)from January 2012 to January 2019 was performed. CD diagnosis was made according to the ESPGHAN algorithm. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utilityof biomarkers and the relationship between TGA-IgA and EMA titers. RESULTS: CDdiagnoses were confirmed in 113 patients, 110 were IgA-TG2-positive and 3 (2.7%) had IgA deficiency. The diagnosis was made by serologic tests in 95 (84.1%)patients. Only 18 (15.9%) patients underwent intestinal biopsy. We obtained 100% concordance between IgA-EMA and positive results for IgA-TG2 >/= 10 ULN withIgA-EMA antibody titer >/= 1:80. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of apositive correlation between IgA-TG2 antibody serum levels and IgA-EMA. Thediagnosis could be guaranteed with strict application of IgA-TG2 values >/= 10ULN (confirmed by subsequent testing) plus the serological response to thegluten-free diet (GFD).

TI  - Transmitted Fetal Immune Response in Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infections duringPregnancy.
LID - 245 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020245 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta, and whether the maternal inflammatory response is transmitted vertically. Thisresearch aims to provide information about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection onmaternal and fetal immunity. (2) Methods: We have studied placental changes andhumoral and cellular immunity in maternal and umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples from a group of pregnant women delivering after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2infection during pregnancy. IgG and IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, Interleukin 1b(IL1b), Interleukin 6 (IL6), and gamma-Interferon (IFN-gamma), have been studied in the UCB samples. Lymphocyte subsets were studied according to CD3, CD8, CD4,CD34, and invariant natural Killer T cells (iNKT) markers. We used in situhybridization techniques for the detection of viral RNA in placentas. (3)Results: During the study period, 79 pregnant women and their correspondingnewborns were recruited. The main gestational age at the time of delivery was39.1 weeks (SD 1.3). We did not find traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in any ofthe analyzed placental samples. Detectable concentrations of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, IL1b, IL6, and IFN-gamma, in UCB were found in all cases, but IgMantibodies anti-ARS-CoV-2 were systematically undetectable. We found significant correlations between fetal CD3+ mononuclear cells and UCB IgG concentrations. We also found significant correlations between UCB IgG concentrations and fetalCD3+/CD4+, as well as CD3+/CD8+ T cells subsets. We also discovered that fetalCD3+/CD8+ cell counts were significantly higher in those cases with placentalinfarctions. (4) Conclusion: we have not verified the placental transfer ofSARS-CoV-2. However, we have discovered that a significant immune response isbeing transmitted to the fetus in cases of SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection.

TI  - Erythropoietin in children with hemolytic uremic syndrome: a pilot randomizedcontrolled trial.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-022-05474-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in sparing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in children with hemolytic uremic syndromerelated to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS) is uncertain.METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled open trial between December2018 and January 2021. Children were randomized to the intervention (subcutaneousrHuEPO 50 U/kg three times weekly until discharge + RBC transfusion if hemoglobin</= 7 g/dL and/or hemodynamic instability) or to the control arm (RBC transfusionif hemoglobin </= 7 g/dL and/or hemodynamic instability). Primary outcome was thenumber of RBC transfusions received during hospitalization. Secondary outcomeswere to explore whether baseline EPO levels were adequate to the degree ofanemia, to correlate selected acute phase parameters with the number of RBCtransfusions, and to assess possible adverse events. RESULTS: Twelve patients perarm were included; they were comparable at recruitment and throughout the diseasecourse. Median number of RBC transfusions was similar between groups (1.5, p =0.76). Most patients had baseline EPO levels adequate to the degree of anemia,which did not correlate with the number of transfusions (r = 0.19, p = 0.44).Conversely, baseline (r = 0.73, p = 0.032) and maximum lactic dehydrogenaselevels (r = 0.78, p = 0.003), creatinine peak (r = 0.71, p = 0.03) and dialysisduration (r = 0.7, p = 0.04) correlated significantly with RBC requirements. Noside effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: In children with STEC-HUS, theadministration of rHuEPO did not reduce the number of RBC transfusions. Largerstudies addressing higher doses and similar severity of kidney failure at rHuEPO initiation (e.g. at start of dialysis) are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776851. A higher resolution version of theGraphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.

AB  - Background: Fast diagnosis of bloodstream infections remains the most importantchallenge for clinical microbiologists. The introduction of the mass-spectrometryrepresents a breakthrough, although several methods are already commonly used forthe direct identification from positive blood cultures we present a faster method(ultra fast) for Lytic anaerobic flasks. Methods: We compare the ultra-fast (UF) method with the extensively employed differential centrifugation method (DC) and both to routine identification after 18-24 h of incubation. UF and DC methodcorrelation rates to the gold standard were calculated, and statisticalsignificance was proved with the Z test. Results: UF performed better overallthan DC, with this difference being statistically significant. This tendency was observed in every subanalysis.

AB  - The marine environment includes diverse microeukaryotic organisms that playimportant functional roles in the ecosystem. With molecular approaches,eukaryotic taxonomy has been improved, complementing classical analysis. In this study, DNA metabarcoding was performed to describe putative pathogenic eukaryoticmicroorganisms in sediment and marine water fractions collected in Galicia (NWSpain) from 2016 to 2018. The composition of eukaryotic communities was distinct between sediment and water fractions. Protists were the most diverse group, with the clade TSAR (Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria, and Telonemida) as theprimary representative organisms in the environment. Harmful algae and invasivespecies were frequently detected. Potential pathogens, invasive pathogenicorganisms as well as the causative agents of harmful phytoplanktonic blooms were identified in this marine ecosystem. Most of the identified pathogens have acrucial impact on the aquacultural sector or affect to relevant species in themarine ecosystem, such as diatoms. Moreover, pathogens with medical andveterinary importance worldwide were also found, as well as pathogens that affectdiatoms. The evaluation of the health of a marine ecosystem that directly affectsthe aquacultural sector with a zoonotic concern was performed with themetabarcoding assay.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is the predominant pathology associated to premature deaths dueto cardiovascular disease. However, early intervention based on a personalizeddiagnosis of cardiovascular risk is very limited. We have previously identifiedmetabolic alterations during atherosclerosis development in a rabbit model and insubjects suffering from an acute coronary syndrome. Here we aim to identifyspecific metabolic signatures which may set the basis for novel tools aidingcardiovascular risk diagnosis in clinical practice. In a cohort of subjects with programmed coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), we have performed liquidchromatography and targeted mass spectrometry analysis in urine and plasma. Therole of vascular smooth muscle cells from human aorta (HA-VSMCs) was alsoinvestigated by analyzing the intra and extracellular metabolites in response to a pro-atherosclerotic stimulus. Statistically significant variation wasconsidered if p value < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney test). Urinary trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), arabitol and spermidine showed higher levels in the CVrisk group comparedwith a control group; while glutamine and pantothenate showed lower levels. Thesame trend was found for plasma TMAO and glutamine. Plasma choline, acetylcholineand valine were also decreased in CVrisk group, while pyruvate was foundincreased. In the secretome of HA-VSMCs, TMAO, pantothenate,glycerophosphocholine, glutathion, spermidine and acetylcholine increased afterpro-atherosclerotic stimulus, while secreted glutamine decreased. Atintracellular level, TMAO, pantothenate and glycerophosphocholine increased with stimulation. Observed metabolic deregulations pointed to an inflammatory responsetogether with a deregulation of oxidative stress counteraction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: After completing formal stroke rehabilitation programs, most patients do not achieve full upper limb motor function recovery. Music-supported Therapy(MST) can improve motor functionality post stroke through musical training. Wedesigned a home-based enriched Music-supported Therapy (eMST) program to provide patients with chronic stroke the opportunity of continuing rehabilitation bythemselves. We developed an app to conduct the eMST sessions at home with aMIDI-piano and percussion instruments. Here, we tested the feasibility of theeMST intervention using the novel app. METHOD: This is a pilot study where fivepatients with chronic stroke underwent a 10-week intervention of 3 sessions perweek. Patients answered feasibility questionnaires throughout the intervention tomodify aspects of the rehabilitation program and the app according to theirfeedback. Upper limb motor functions were evaluated pre- and post-intervention aswell as speed and force tapping during daily piano performance. RESULTS: Patientsclinically improved in upper limb motor function achieving the Minimal DetectableChange (MDC) or Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in most of motortests. The app received high usability ratings post-intervention. CONCLUSION: TheeMST program is a feasible intervention for patients with chronic stroke and its efficacy should be assessed in a clinical trial.

TI  - Identification of Exosomal MicroRNA Signature by Liquid Biopsy in HereditaryHemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients.
LID - 9450 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms22179450 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant vasculardysplasia characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, andarteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the visceral organs. The diagnosis of HHT isbased on clinical Curacao criteria, which show limited sensitivity in childrenand young patients. Here, we carried out a liquid biopsy by which we isolatedtotal RNA from plasma exosome samples. A cohort of 15 HHT type 1 patients, 15 HHTtype 2 patients, and 10 healthy relatives were analyzed. Upon gene expressiondata processing and normalization, a statistical analysis was performed toexplore similarities in microRNA expression patterns among samples and detectdifferentially expressed microRNAs between HHT samples and the control group. We found a disease-associated molecular fingerprint of 35 miRNAs over-represented inHHT vs. controls, with eight being specific for HHT1 and 11 for HHT2; we alsofound 30 under-represented, including nine distinct for HHT1 and nine for HHT2.The analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed thateight miRNAs had good (AUC > 75%) or excellent (AUC > 90%) diagnosis value forHHT and even for type HHT1 and HHT2. In addition, we identified the cellularorigin of these miRNAs among the cell types involved in the vascularmalformations. Interestingly, we found that only some of them were incorporatedinto exosomes, which suggests a key functional role of these exosomal miRNAs inthe pathophysiology of HHT.

TI  - Is Hospital Exemption an Alternative or a Bridge to European Medicines Agency forDeveloping Academic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell in Europe? Our Experiencewith ARI-0001.
PG  - 1004-1007
LID - 10.1089/hum.2021.168 [doi]
AB  - The hospital exemption (HE) allows for the use of advanced therapy medicinalproducts (ATMPs) next to marketing authorization (MA), but under specialconditions. The HE is only applicable to individual patients treated in thehospital setting and it is limited to member states of the European Union (EU);HE is mainly conceded to the academic centers that developed the ATMP, beinggranted by the national competent authority (NCA), which, in the case of Spain,is the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS). The HE followsstrict standards of traceability, pharmacovigilance, and quality. In February2021, our ATMP ARI-0001, a new autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)targeting CD19, was approved by AEMPS under HE for patients >25 years withrelapsed or refractory CD19(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This authorizationwas a first step in the development of, and access to, academic CAR T cellproducts in the EU. The fact that HE is limited to a specific country andhospital, the need of continuous evaluation by the NCA, and the potential future overlap with other centrally approved ATMPs, suggest that the HE could be used asan intermediate step before obtaining a centralized MA by the European Medicines Agency.

TI  - Impact of Immune Response in Short-term and Long-term Outcomes After MinimallyInvasive Surgery for Colorectal Liver Metastases: Results From a RandomizedStudy.
PG  - 690-696
LID - 10.1097/SLE.0000000000000980 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential benefit related to laparoscopic liver surgery (LLS) forcolorectal liver metastases outcomes is not well known. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Serum cytokines associated with Th1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and Th2[interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6] phenotypes were measured in 36 patients operatedon for colorectal liver metastases by open liver surgery (OLS) and LLS.Measurements were performed at 3 time points: 1 day before surgery, day 3postoperative, and 1 month postoperative. We compared the postoperativeinflammatory response influence between LLS and OLS on long-term outcomes.RESULTS: In both groups, only IL-6 levels on day 3 postoperative were higher thanthose measured preoperatively and at 1 month. Comparing the tumor necrosisfactor-alpha levels between the LLS and OLS groups, preoperative (7.28 vs. 2.36),day 3 (7.99 vs. 4.08) and 1 month (7.39 vs. 1.99) postoperative levels werehigher in the OLS group (P<0.01, <0.01, and <0.01, respectively). In contrast,IL-10 levels were higher in the LLS group preoperatively (7.51 vs. 4.57) and onday 3 postoperative (13.40 vs. 4.57) (P=0.03 and 0.01, respectively). A cut-offIL-6 level of >/=4.41 in the first month was associated with a higher risk ofrecurrence (logrank=4.8, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Both LLS and OLS induce an initialincrease in IL-6 that normalizes one month after surgery, showing a similarpattern. In addition, a cut-off IL-6 value of 4.41 pg/mL was established, with a higher concentration at 1 month postoperative possibly related to a higher riskor recurrence.

AB  - Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Duringanaphylaxis, mediator release by effector cells causes endothelial barrierbreakdown, increasing vascular permeability and leakage of fluids, which may leadto tissue edema. Although endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in thiscontext, scant attention has been paid to the molecular analysis of the vascular system, and further analyses of this cell type are necessary, especially inhumans. The protein expression pattern of human microvascular ECs was analyzed inresponse to sera from anaphylactic patients (EC-anaphylaxis) and sera fromnon-allergic subjects (EC-control) after 2 hours of contact. Firstly, adifferential quantitative proteomic analysis of the protein extracts wasperformed by mass spectrometry using an isobaric labeling method. Second, thecoordinated behavior of the identified proteins was analyzed using systemsbiology analysis (SBA). The proteome of the EC-anaphylaxis system showed 7,707proteins, of which 1,069 were found to be significantly altered between theEC-control and EC-anaphylaxis groups (p-value < 0.05). Among them, a subproteome of 47 proteins presented a high rate of change (|DeltaZq| >/= 3). This paneloffers an endothelial snapshot of the anaphylactic reaction. Those proteins with the highest individual changes in abundance were hemoglobin subunits andstructural support proteins. The interacting network analysis of this alteredsubproteome revealed that the coagulation and complement systems are the mainbiological processes altered in the EC-anaphylactic system. The comprehensive SBAresulted in 5,512 functional subcategories (biological processes), 57 of whichwere significantly altered between EC-control and EC-anaphylaxis. The complement system, once again, was observed as the main process altered in the EC systemcreated with serum from anaphylactic patients. Findings of the current studyfurther our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanismsoperating in anaphylactic reactions. New target proteins and relevant signalingpathways operating in the in vitro endothelial-serum system have been identified.Interestingly, our results offer a protein overview of the micro-EC-anaphylaxisenvironment. The relevance of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, contact andcomplement systems in human anaphylaxis is described. Additionally, theuntargeted high-throughput analysis used here is a novel approach that revealsnew pathways in the study of the endothelial niche in anaphylaxis.

TI  - Clinical, randomized, double blind clinical trial to study the effect ofparenteral supplementation with fish oil emulsion in the nutritional support inesophagectomized patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Esophagectomy is a major surgery with a high degree of catabolicand post-surgical inflammatory response accompanied by high morbidity andsignificant mortality. Post-surgical nutritional support via enteraladministration of omega-3 fatty acids has been seen to be effective although its bad tolerance. There are few clinical trials with parenteral omega-3 fatty acids in these patients. We propose to investigate the effect of combining a parenteralfish oil lipid emulsion with the standard enteral nutrition (EN) support.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind studyin esophagectomized patients, and treated after surgery with parenteral lipidemulsions of omega-3 fatty acids or a mixture of omega-6 long-chaintriglycerides/short-chain triglycerides 50%. These emulsions will be added to thestandard nutritional support in continuous infusion until 5 days of treatmenthave been completed. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 in Group A receiving 0.4g/kg/d of fish-oil lipid emulsion and 0.4 g/kg/d of a lipid emulsion mixture ofomega-6 long-chain fatty acids (LCT) plus medium-chain fatty acids (MCT) (totaldose of 0.8 g/kg/d of lipid emulsion); Group B receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of fish oillipid emulsion and Group C receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of LCT/MCT emulsion.The mainobjective is to determine whether 5 days administration of intravenous omega-3fatty acid lipid emulsion is effective in normalizing interleukin-6 levelscompared with LCT/MCT emulsions, and whether a 0.8 g/kg/d dose is more effective than 0.4 g/kg/d. Secondary outcomes include other inflammatory markers such asC-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10, andparameters of morbidity, safety, nutrition and mortality.Samples will becollected at the time when surgery is indicated and on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 21 to determine inflammatory, nutritional, hepatic and safety parameters. In addition, clinical follow-up will be continued throughout the hospital admision and up to 1year after surgery. DISCUSSION: Studies of omega-3 fatty acids administeredparenterally in esophagectomized patients are scarce. This study proposes toinvestigate the effect of combining fish-oil lipid emulsions administeredparenterally with EN support. Potential benefits include fast incorporation oflipids to the cellular membranes and to the inflammatory cascade, and the use of only 1 pharmaconutrient.

LID - 10.3390/medicina57050469 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Pre-term premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)responds for one third of preterm births, and it is associated with othercomplications that increase the risk of maternal or fetal poor outcome. To reduceuncertainty and provide accurate information to patients, the analysis of thelarge series is of great importance. In order to learn about the evolution overthe time of the obstetric and perinatal outcomes in cases of PPROM at, or before,28 weeks (very early PPROM) managed with an expectant/conservative protocol, wehave designed the present study.&nbsp;Materials and Methods: We retrospectivelystudied all cases of very early PPROM attended in Malaga University RegionalHospital from 2000 to 2020. Results: Among 119,888 deliveries assisted, 592 casesof PPROM occurred in pregnancies at or before 28 weeks (0.49% of all deliveries, 3.9% of all preterm births and 12.9% of all cases of PPROM). The mean duration ofthe latency period between PPROM and delivery was 13.5 days (range 0 to 88 days),enlarging over the years. The mean gestational age at delivery was 27 weeks (SD2.9; range 17-34). The proportion of cesarean deliveries was 52.5%. The overallperinatal mortality rate was 26.5%, decreasing over the period with a significantcorrelation Pearson's coefficient -0.128 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In the period2000-2020, there was an improvement in the outcomes of very early PPROM cases andperinatal mortality showed a clear trend to decrease.

LID - 560 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes12040560 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and extremely heterogeneousneurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with a strong genetic component. In recentyears, the clinical relevance of de novo mutations to the aetiology of ASD hasbeen demonstrated. Current guidelines recommend chromosomal microarray (CMA) and a FMR1 testing as first-tier tests, but there is increasing evidence that supportthe use of NGS for the diagnosis of NDDs. Specifically in ASD, it has not beenextensively evaluated and, thus, we performed and compared the clinical utilityof CMA, FMR1 testing, and/or whole exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 343 ASD patients. We achieved a global diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority ofthem being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) compared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) orFMR1 testing (2/44; 4.5%). Taking into account the age at which genetic testingwas carried out, we identified a causal genetic alteration in 22.5% (37/164) ofpatients over 5 years old, but only in 3.9% (7/179) of patients under this age.Our data evidence the higher diagnostic power of WES compared to CMA in the studyof ASD and support the implementation of WES as a first-tier test for the geneticdiagnosis of this disorder, when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), aninfectious disease that leads to numerous deaths worldwide. Malnutrition,smoking, alcohol abuse, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, and diabetes are some of the most important risk factors associated with TB development. Atpresent, it is necessary to conduct studies on risk factors to establish neweffective strategies and combat this disease. Malnutrition has been establishedas a risk factor since several years ago; although there is in vitro experimentalevidence that reveals the importance of micronutrients in activating the immuneresponse against M.tb, evidence from clinical trials is controversial. Currently,nutritional assessment is recommended in all TB patients upon diagnosis. However,there is insufficient evidence to indicate micronutrient supplementation asadjuvant therapy or prophylactic to prevent micronutrient depletion.Strengthening the interaction between basic and clinical research is necessary tocarry out studies that will help establish adjuvant therapies to improve outcomesin TB patients. In this review, we discuss the experimental evidence, provided bybasic research, regarding micronutrients in the TB field. However, when thesestudies are applied to clinical trials, the data are inconsistent, indicatingthat still missing mechanisms are necessary to propose alternatives to thetreatment of TB patients.

PG  - 761-771
LID - 10.1111/cge.13936 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the applicability of the use of samples in dried blood spot (DBS) for the definitive diagnosis of Fabry disease (FD) inmales and females and to compare the diagnostic role of alpha-galactosidase Aactivity (alpha-Gal A), levels of lyso-Gb3 and sequencing of the GLA gene inscreening patients with suspected FD. Measurement of alpha-Gal A activity insuspected FD patients in DBS was made followed by lyso-Gb3 determination and GLA gene sequencing. Of the 2381 subjects analyzed, FD was confirmed in 24 patients. Thirteen different variants were considered like pathogenic, five of which hadnot been previously described (c.143A > G; c.455A > C; c.487G > T; c.554delA;c.1045_1046insA). None of the patients with normal enzyme activity had FDconfirmation. The DBS measurement of alpha-Gal A was more sensitive than lyso-Gb3levels in both men and women. Definitive diagnosis of FD from a single DBS ispossible, allowing samples to be easily sent from anywhere to the referencelaboratory.

AB  - The impact of the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in hemodialysis patients remainspoorly characterized. Some hemodialysis techniques reduce systemic inflammationbut their impact on COVID-19 has not been addressed. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 hemodialysis patients, including the impact of reducing interleukin-6 using a cytokineadsorbent filter. This is a prospective single-center study including 16hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. All were dialyzed using a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) filter. Interleukin-6 levels were obtained before and afterthe first admission hemodialysis session and at 1 week. Baseline comorbidities,laboratory values, chest X-ray, and treatments were recorded and compared betweensurvivors and non-survivors. Out of 16 patients (13 males, mean age 72 +/- 15years), 4 (25%) died. Factors associated with mortality were dialysis vintage (P = 0.01), chest X-ray infiltrates (P = 0.032), serum C-reactive protein (P =0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.02) at 1 week, oxygen therapy requirement(P = 0.02) and anticoagulation (P < 0.01). At admission, non-survivors had higherpredialysis and postdialysis interleukin-6 levels (P = 0.02 for both) and did notpresent the reduction of interleukin-6 levels during the dialysis session withPMMA filter that was observed in survivors (survivors vs. non-survivors: 25.0[17.5-53.2]% vs. -2.8 [-109.4-12.8]% reduction, P = 0.04). A positive balance of interleukin-6 during the admission dialysis was associated with mortality (P =0.008). In conclusion, in hemodialysis COVID-19 patients, a positiveinterleukin-6 balance during the admission hemodialysis session was associatedwith higher mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the antibacterial activity against mono andmultispecies bacterial models and the cytotoxic effects of zinc oxide and copper nanoparticles(ZnO-NPs/Cu-NPs) in cell cultures of human gingivalfibroblasts(HGFs). DESIGN: The antibacterial activities of ZnO-NPs and Cu-NPsagainst 4 bacteria species were tested according to their minimum inhibitoryconcentrations(MICs) and against mature multispecies anaerobic model by spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy. The viabilities and cytotoxic effects ofZnO-NPs and Cu-NPs to HGFs cell cultures were tested by MTT, LDH assays,production of ROS, and the activation of caspase-3. The results were analyzedusing one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey tests, considering p<0.05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: For all strains, MICs of ZnO-NPs and Cu-NPs were in therange of 78.3mug/mL-3906mug/mL and 125mug/mL-625 ug/mL, respectively. In amultispecies model, a significant decrease in the total biomass volume(mu3) wasobserved in response to exposure to 125mug/mL of each NPs for which there wasbactericidal activity. Significant differences were found between the volumes of viable and nonviable biomass exposed to nanostructures with Cu-NPs compared toZnO-NPs. Both NPs induced mitochondrial dose-dependent cytotoxicity, ZnO-NPsincreases LDH release and intracellular ROS generation. Cu-NPs at a concentrationof 50mug/mL induced production of cleaved caspase-3, activating the apoptoticpathway early and at low doses. CONCLUSIONS: After 24h, ZnO-NPs are biocompatiblebetween 78-100mug/mL and Cu-NPs below 50mug/mL. Antibacterial activity in amonospecies model is strain dependent, and in a multispecies model was a lowerdoses after 10min of exposure.

AB  - The advances in molecular biology and the emergence of Next Generation Sequencing(NGS) have revealed that microbiome composition is closely related with healthand disease, including cancer. This relationship affects different levels ofcancer such as development, progression, and response to treatment includingimmunotherapy. The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may beinfluenced by the concomitant use of antibiotics before, during or shortly after treatment with ICIs. Nevertheless, the linking mechanism between microbiote, hostimmunity and cancer is not clear and the role of microbiota manipulation andanalyses in cancer management has not been clinically validated yet. Regardingthe use of microbiome as biomarker to predict ICI efficacy it has been recentlyshown that the use of biochemical serum markers to monitor intestinalpermeability and loss of barrier integrity, like citrulline, could be useful tomonitor microbiota changes and predict ICI efficacy. There are still manyunknowns about the role of these components, their relationship with themicrobiota, with the use of antibiotics and the response to immunotherapy. Thenext challenge in microbiome research will be to identify individual microbialspecies that causally affect lung cancer phenotypes and response to ICI anddisentangle the underlying mechanisms. Thus, further analyses in patients withlung cancer receiving treatment with ICIs and its correlation with thecomposition of the microbiota in different organs including the respiratorytract, peripheral blood and intestinal tract could be useful to predict theefficacy of ICIs and its modulation with antibiotic use.

TI  - Colchicine treatment in children with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis,pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome: A multicenter study inSpain.
LID - 10.5152/eurjrheum.2020.20102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of colchicine therapy in pediatric patientswith PFAPA syndrome who present with an incomplete response to the standardtreatment or with frequent episodes (an interval of less than 14 days between twodisease flares). METHODS: A multicenter cohort study of children diagnosed withPFAPA syndrome and treated with colchicine was performed in three separatehospitals located in Spain. The patients clinical and laboratory data werereviewed by accessing their medical records. Response to colchicine was evaluatedafter 12 months of treatment for frequency, duration, and intensity of PFAPAepisodes. RESULTS: A total of 13 children were included in our study, 43% of whomwere boys. Median age of the colchicine therapy initiation was 6 years(interquartile range (IQR)=3-9.5). Following a 12-month period of colchicinetherapy (median dosage of 0.02 mg/kg/day; IQR=0.02-0.03), a significant decrease in the median number of flares (median 8; IQR=7-14 vs 3; IQR=2-4; p=0.005) andthe duration of disease episodes (median 4 days; IQR=3.25-5.125 vs 1 day;IQR=1-2; p=0.003) was observed. Furthermore, the highest degree of fever duringdisease flares was reduced from median 40 masculineC (IQR=39.5-40) to 38.5masculineC (IQR=37.7-38.9) (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Colchicine therapy decreasedthe frequency and intensity of PFAPA. The use of colchicine could be an effectivetreatment in pediatric patients with PFAPA syndrome who present with frequent or severe relapses.

AB  - Mexican Mixtec population from coastal Jamiltepec (Oaxaca) Amerindians wasstudied for its HLA profile. They show genetic characteristics close to PacificIslanders and other Mexican Isthmus Amerindians (Mazatecans, Zapotecans andMayas). Interestingly, this coastal Oaxaca Mixtec population is geneticallycloser to Mazatecans than to Oaxaca Mixtec from mountains according to HLA genes.Mixtec HLA frequent extended haplotype A*24:02-B*35:14-DRB1*16:02 has been alsofound in Jaidukama North Colombia forest Amerindians and in Guatemala Mayas;A*24:02, DRB1*04:03, DRB1*04:04 and DRB2*16:02 are frequent alleles also commonto Pacific Inhabitants. Notwithstanding, Mixtecs show deep cultural and geneticroots with Mesoamerican Amerindians and all of them probably contributed toconstruct Monte Alban culture around an important Pyramid Complex close to OaxacaCity.

In the present study we haveanalyzed Bolivian Quechua HLA profile and found that it has common characterswith other Andean and Pacific Amerindians (Uros, Aymaras, Lamas, Mapuches,Athabascan), and Pacific Islanders, including Easter Islanders: relatively highfrequency of HLA-A*24 (:02), class II haplotypes DRB1*08:02-DQB1*04:02, andDRB1*04:03-DQB1* 03:02. Titikaka Lake area prehistoric populations: Quechua,Aymaras and Uros are closely related according to HLA Nei DA genetic distancesand other HLA traits: they built up Tiwanaku culture, which resembles that ofEaster Island (i.e.: similar giant heads); later, Quechuas also moved to Cuzco.This genetic reletedness together with Easter Island and Titikaka Lake Tiwanaku(Bolivia, Peru) cultural common similarities support a prehistoric Pacificpeople/Amerindians gene flow.

AB  - Aymara people has been a relatively homogeneous group since Spanish Conquest by1,532 CE, even if previously represented a group of various cultural definedpopulations who gave rise to them. They were and are established in AndeanAltiplano around Titikaka Lake (Bolivia, Peru), Argentina and Chile neighborhood,speak Aymara language and have been maintained after Europeans arrival at a lowersocial status than Quechua (Inca) speaking people. However, both Aymara andQuechua populations acknowledge Titikaka Lake as center of their origins; bothlanguages are also related. Specific high frequencies of HLA-A*02, -A*24 and-A*68, HLA-B*35, -B*39 and -B*48, HLA-DRB1*08:02, -DRB1*09:01, and -DRB1*14:02,and HLA-DQB1*04:02, -DQB1*03:02 and -DQB1*03:01 alleles are found in Aymaras and HLA class II haplotypes common to Andean Amerindians (DRB1*08:02-DQB1*04:02 andDRB1*04:03-DQB1*03:02), like Quechua, Aymara, Uros, Lamas and Mapuche are alsofound in Easter and other Pacific Islands. Giant human head stone statues atTiwanaku (Titikaka Lake, Bolivia) are also found at Easter Island. Thus, it ispossible a gene and cultural flow between Andean Amerindians and Easter and otherPacific Islands, as it was demonstrated by Thor Heyerdahl in his Kon-Tikiexpedition which reached Pacific Islands sailing from El Callao Harbour (Lima,Peru).

AB  - Huastecos or Teenek Amerindians are presently living at North East Mexico (SanLuis Potosi State). They have probably one of the most ancient culture of Mexico and Central America together with Mayas and Olmec groups with which also showclose relationships. Proximity to Atlantic Ocean/Mexican Gulf originated thatSpaniards had very early contact with them at about 1519 CE or before. In thepresent paper we have aimed to study HLA gene profile which may be useful for HLAand disease epidemiology and transplant programs in Teeneks. HLA-DRB1*04:07,-DRB1*14:06 and -DRB1*04:11 have been found in high frequency like in otherAmerindian groups. High frequency typical Amerindians HLA extended haplotypeshave been found, such as A*02-B*35-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02;A*68-B*39-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02 and A*02-B*39-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02; also newhaplotypes have been described, like A*02-B*52-DRB1*04:11-DQB1*03:02,A*68-B*35-DRB1*14:02-DQB1*03:01 and A*68-B*40-DRB1*16:02-DQB1*03:01. Geneticproximity is observed not only to linguistically close Mayans, but also toMazatecans, Mixtecans and Zapotecans, who speak an altogether differentlanguages; it shows once more that genes and languages do not correlate. Thispopulation was greatly diminished after European contact between 1500 and 1600years CE; in fact, North and South America First Inhabitants population wasbrought from 80 down to 8 million people because of diseases (i.e.: measles,smallpox or influenza), slavery and war.

AB  - Mexican Mayo Amerindians live in southern Sonora and North Sinaloa states. Theyprobably come from North or are related to First American Inhabitants establishedfurther North. A non-related sample of them have volunteered to HLA study inorder to achieve a profile useful for their epidemiology and future transplantinterstate programs, in addition to ascertain ancestry and anthropologicalstudies. HLA typing was carried out by a standard methodology. HLA-B*48 allele(s)was found, which is characteristic of Pacific Amerindians and PacificIslanders/southern Asians. Also, HLA-A*24 (most likely HLA-A*24:02) showsspecific high frequencies in this population and also in indigenous people, like Aleuts, Alaska Yupik, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,southern China and other Pacific Islands. Other Andean Amerindians also show ahigh HLA-A*24:02 frequencies. This confirms our previous results of a possibledirect gene flow between Pacific Islanders/southern Asians and Amerindians. Inaddition, typical Amerindian haplotypes have been found in high frequency likeHLA-A*24-B*39-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02, HLA-A*02-B*35-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02 andHLA-A*24-B*35-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02, and new haplotypes are also described likeHLA-A*02-B*35-DRB1*14:06-DQB1*03:01, HLA-A*02-B*48-DRB1*04:04-DQB1*03:02, andHLA-A*02-B*08-DRB1*04:07-DQB1*03:02. This study also supports that Americaspeopling was not only carried out through Bering Strait but also through Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in an earlier time than proposed.

AB  - Intratumoral delivery of viruses and virus-associated molecular patterns canachieve antitumor effects that are largely mediated by the elicitation orpotentiation of immune responses against the malignancy. Attenuated vaccines are approved and marketed as good manufactiring practice (GMP)-manufactured agentswhose administration might be able to induce such effects. Recent reports inmouse transplantable tumor models indicate that the rotavirus, influenza andyellow fever vaccines can be especially suitable to elicit powerful antitumorimmunity against cancer following intratumoral administration. These resultshighlight that intratumoral anti-infectious vaccines can turn cold tumors intohot, and underscore the key role played by virus-induced type I interferonpathways to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint-targeted antibodies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The biocompatibility of dialysis membranes is a determining factor inavoiding chronic microinflammation in patients under haemodialysis. Lowerbiocompatibility has been related to increased inflammatory status, which isknown to be associated with cardiovascular events. Classically, cellulosemembranes have been considered bioincompatible. A new-generation of asymmetriccellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes allows the performance of high convectivetransport techniques, but there have been no studies of their biocompatibility.The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare the biocompatibilitycharacteristics of 4 membranes, including CTA, in online hemodiafiltration(OL-HDF) patients. METHODS: We included 15 patients in -OL-HDF. After a 2-weekwashout period with helixone membrane, each patient was treated with the 4membranes (polyamide, polynephron, helixone and CTA) for 4 weeks in a randomized order. The other dialysis parameters were kept stable throughout the study. Westudied changes in markers of the activation of the complement system, monocytes,platelets, and adhesion molecules with the 4 membranes, as well as inflammatoryparameters. RESULTS: Biocompatibility was similar among the membranes. There wereno sustained differences in complement activation, measured by C3a and C5alevels, or in platelet activation, determined by levels of P-selectin andplatelet-derived microparticles (CD41a+). No differences were observed inactivated monocyte levels (CD14+/CD16+) or in plasma levels of interleukin(IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10 or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, although tumournecrosis factor-alpha levels decreased when the patients were dialyzed with CTA. No significant differences were found in markers of endothelial damage, assessed by levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and adhesion molecules(intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1).CONCLUSION: The 4 membranes evaluated in this study in stable patients on OL-HDF,including the new-generation CTA, show similar biocompatibility with the methods applied.

AB  - Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been the focus ofintensive research because of its crucial role in the pathogenesis of differentdiseases across many medical specialties. In this context, the present review in which a panel of 13 experts in immunology, dermatology, rheumatology, neurology, hematology, infectious diseases, hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology andoncology have been involved, puts in common the mechanisms through which IL-17 isconsidered a molecular target for the development of novel biological therapiesin these different fields. A comprehensive review of the literature and analysis of the most outstanding evidence have provided the basis for discussing the most relevant data related to IL-17A blocking agents for the treatment of differentdisorders, such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,ankylosing spondylitis, cardiovascular disorders, non alcoholic fatty liverdisease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, hematologicaland solid cancer. Current controversies are presented giving an opening line for future research.

AB  - The Colombian population is characterised by a high genetic diversity, secondary to the ethnic mixture arising from colonisation. Unfortunately, few reports areavailable regarding HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 diversity in Colombia to date. HLA-DRB1 andDQB1 diversity was identified in this study using next-generating sequencing(NGS) on a cohort of Colombian women. Cervical samples taken from 276 women were used for typing DRB1 and DQB1 loci by Illumina MiSeq. Allele and haplotypefrequencies were calculated using an expectation-maximisation algorithm.Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between loci wereevaluated. Forty-seven DRB1 alleles and 14 DQB1 alleles were identified.DRB1*04:07:01G and DQB1*03:02:01G alleles occurred most frequently in the target population. Significant LD was found in 44 out of the 144 identified haplotypes, within which DRB1*04:07:01G-DQB1*03:02:01G occurred most frequently (6.56%). The alleles and haplotypes found with NGS agreed with that found in previous reports involving lower resolution for the Colombian population, and greater geneticvariability was found, especially concerning DRB1. Comparing allele and haplotypefrequency distribution in the target population to that of other populationsdenoted HLA system intra- and inter-population diversity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to analyze the association between HCV coinfection and cumulativeinfections with the development of a cardiovascular disease in HIV-infectedsubjects. METHODS: HIV-infected subjects attended at Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, between January 1982 and March 2018, were considered if fulfilled thefollowing criteria: at least two visits to the HIV clinic, clinical records with data about VZV reactivation and bacterial infections, available data on HCVcoinfection status. Atherogenic cardiovascular events were registered. To analyzefactors associated with the development of cardiovascular event, a logisticregression analysis was performed. RESULTS: 823 subjects were included in thestudy. During the observational period, 58/823 (7.05%) developed a cardiovascularevent. Advanced age at HIV-1 diagnosis, a low T-CD4 nadir, HCV coinfection andthe burden of infections were independently associated with the risk ofdeveloping a cardiovascular event, apart from lipid levels and diabetes.CONCLUSIONS: both HCV and the burden of infections are associated with anincreased risk of cardivascular event in HIV-infected patients, together withother cardiovascular risk factors. Therapeutic strategies such as HCVerradication or VZV immunization could ameliorate cardiovascular risk in thesesubjects.

AB  - The genetic data of 17 Y chromosome short tandem repeats in 146 unrelated donorresidents in the provinces of Granada, Malaga, and Almeria (GMA) were analyzed todetermine the genetic legacy of the male inhabitants of the former Kingdom ofGranada. A total of 139 unique haplotypes were identified. Observed allelefrequencies and haplogroup frequencies were also analyzed. By AMOVA and STRUCTUREanalysis, the populations of the 3 provinces could be treated genetically as asingle population. The most frequent haplogroup was R1b1b2 (58.22%). By networkanalysis of all individuals, we observed a distribution according to haplogroupassignment. To improve the characterization of GMA population, it was comparedwith those of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and southern Europe. In ouranalysis of allele frequencies and genetic distances, the GMA population laywithin the Spanish population group. Further, in the STRUCTURE analysis, therewas no African component in the GMA population, confirming that, based on ourgenetic markers, the GMA population does not reflect any male genetic influenceof the North African people. The presence of African haplogroups in the GMApopulation is irrelevant when their frequency is compared with those in otherEuropean populations.

TI  - Patient blood management in obstetrics: prevention and treatment of postpartumhaemorrhage. A NATA consensus statement.
PG  - 112-136
LID - 10.2450/2019.0245-18 [doi]
AB  - Patient blood management (PBM) is the timely application of evidence-informedmedical and surgical concepts designed to maintain haemoglobin concentration,optimise haemostasis, and minimise blood loss in an effort to improve patientoutcomes. The aim of this consensus statement is to provide recommendations onthe prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage as part of PBM inobstetrics. A multidisciplinary panel of physicians with expertise in obstetrics,anaesthesia, haematology, and transfusion medicine was convened by the Networkfor the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis(NATA) in collaboration with the International Federation of Gynaecology andObstetrics (FIGO), the European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology(EBCOG), and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA). Members of the taskforce assessed the quantity, quality and consistency of the published evidence,and formulated recommendations using the system developed by the Grading ofRecommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group.The recommendations in this consensus statement are intended for use by clinical practitioners managing perinatal care of women in all settings, and bypolicy-makers in charge of decision making for the update of clinical practice inhealth care establishments.

TI  - Clinical features of systemic sclerosis patients with anti-RNA polymerase IIIantibody in a single centre in Spain.
PG  - 41-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical features and survival of patients withpositive anti-RNA polymerase III (anti-RNAP III) in a Spanish single centre.METHODS: We analysed 221 patients with SSc according to LeRoy and Medsgercriteria. Twenty-six patients with positivity for anti-RNAP III antibodies werecompared with 195 negative patients. Epidemiological, clinical, immunologicalfeatures and survival were analysed. RESULTS: In patients with anti-RNAP IIIpositivity diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) subset was the most prevalent (20, 76.9%vs. 35, 17.9%, p < 0.001), with shorter diagnosis delay (4.11 +/- 7.34 years vs. 6.77 +/- 9.22 years, p = 0.005). Patients with anti-RNAP III antibodies hadhigher frequency of arterial hypertension (13, 50% vs. 55, 28.2%, p = 0.024),scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) (3, 11.5% vs. 3, 1.5%, p = 0.023), arthritis (9,34.6% vs. 35, 17.9%, p = 0.046), tendon friction rubs (4, 15.4% vs. 1, 0.5%, p = 0.001) and contractures (5, 19.2% vs. 10, 5.1%, p = 0.02). There were nodifferences found in the presence of cancer or in global survival. In themultivariate survival analysis, severe interstitial lung disease (ILD) (HR: 8.61,95%CI 3.40 - 21.81), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (HR: 4.05, 95%CI 1.42 - 11.61) and SRC (HR: 17.27, 95%CI 3.36 - 88.97) were the only factors associatedwith poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort anti-RNAP III antibodies arerelated with dcSSc subset, shorter diagnostic delay and higher prevalence ofmusculoskeletal involvement, arterial hypertension and SRC. ILD, PAH and SRC wereindependent prognostic factors.

TI  - "Living an Obstacle Course": A Qualitative Study Examining the Experiences ofCaregivers of Children with Rett Syndrome.
LID - E41 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16010041 [doi]
AB  - Background: Rett syndrome has considerable effects on the quality of life ofaffected children, impairing everyday activities and potentially impacting thelife of both the caregivers and the family. Our aim was to explore theexperiences of a group of caregivers of children with Rett syndrome with regards to living and caring for their children. Methods: We conducted a qualitative casestudy to examine how 31 caregivers of children with Rett syndrome perceivedliving with their children. Data were collected through in-depth interviews,focus groups, researchers' field notes and caregivers' personal documents. Athematic analysis was performed following the Consolidated Criteria for ReportingQualitative Research (COREQ) guideline. Results: The experience of being acaregiver of a child with Rett syndrome was expressed as being akin to an"obstacle course", and was described via three main themes: (a) looking foranswers, with two subthemes identified, namely 'the first symptoms', and 'theneed for a diagnosis'; (b) managing day to day life, with the subthemes 'applyingtreatments', and 'learning to care'; and (c) money matters. Conclusions: Rettsyndrome has a considerable impact on the lives of the caregivers involved. Thehealth-care process and the management of economic resources are some of theaspects highlighted by caregivers. These findings have important implications forthe planning of support services, health systems and health policies.

AB  - Endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors comprise a highly heterogeneous group ofneoplasms that can arise from (neuro)endocrine cells, either from endocrineglands or from the widespread diffuse neuroendocrine system, and, consequently,are widely distributed throughout the body. Due to their diversity, heterogeneityand limited incidence, studying in detail the molecular and genetic alterationsthat underlie their development and progression is still a highly elusive task.This, in turn, hinders the discovery of novel therapeutic options for thesetumors. To circumvent these limitations, numerous mouse models of endocrine andneuroendocrine tumors have been developed, characterized and used inpre-clinical, co-clinical (implemented in mouse models and patientssimultaneously) and post-clinical studies, for they represent powerful andnecessary tools in basic and translational tumor biology research. Indeed,different in vivo mouse models, including cell line-based xenografts (CDXs),patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMs),have been used to delineate the development, progression and behavior of humantumors. Results gained with these in vivo models have facilitated the clinicalapplication in patients of diverse breakthrough discoveries made in this field.Herein, we review the generation, characterization and translatability of themost prominent mouse models of endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors reported todate, as well as the most relevant clinical implications obtained for eachendocrine and neuroendocrine tumor type.

AB  - AIMS/BACKGROUND: To evaluate the correlation between protein S100B concentrationsmeasured in the jugular bulb as well as at peripheral level and the prognosticusefulness of this marker. METHODS: A prospective study of all patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute brain damage was carried out. Peripheraland jugular bulb blood samples were collected upon admission and every 24h forthree days. The endpoints were brain death diagnosis and the Glasgow OutcomeScale score after 6months. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included. Jugularprotein S100B levels were greater than systemic levels upon admission and alsoafter 24 and 72h (mean difference>0). Jugular protein S100B levels showedacceptable precision in predicting brain death both upon admission [AUC 0.67 (95%CI 0.53-0.80)] and after 48h [AUC 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.89)]. Similar results were obtained regarding the capacity of jugular protein S100B levels upon admission topredict an unfavourable outcome (AUC 0.69 (95% CI 0.56-0.79)). The gradient upon admission (jugular-peripheral levels) showed its capacity to predict thedevelopment of brain death [AUC 0.74 (95% CI 0.62-0.86)] and together with theGlasgow Coma Scale constituted the independent factors associated with thedevelopment of brain death. CONCLUSION: Regional protein S100B determinations arehigher than systemic determinations, thus confirming the cerebral origin ofprotein S100B. The transcranial protein S100B gradient is correlated to thedevelopment of brain death.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on patients' qualityof life (QoL) compared to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using the 36-ItemShort Form (SF-36) health questionnaire in Argentina. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Cross-sectional study. All consecutive MS patients, SLE and healthy controls (HC)were included. Demographics, clinical and radiological aspects, EDSS and SF-36were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 191 subjects were included (MS=74, SLE=30 and HC=87). When we compared, using 2 standard deviations below the normal mean, the SF-36 subscales scores between MS and SLE, we found that MS patients experienced significant deterioration in general health (p<0.0001), vitality (p=0.009),current health (p<0.0001) and previous year health perception (p=0.003).Additional evaluated areas did not show significant differences. MS patientsscored significantly lower in all categories compared to HC, except for bodilypain. An inverse correlation between EDSS and SF-36 total (R(2)=0.59, beta-11.08, p<0.0001) and subscale scores was observed after applying regressionanalysis. CONCLUSION: MS behaves as a systemic disease from the functional point of view. Patient-reported QoL scales scores provide comprehensive additionalprognostic information beyond the EDSS score. Therefore, adding the SF-36questionnaire in clinical practice might be useful for the assessment andfollow-up of MS patients.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in complex models of continuous infection is a currentissue. The update 2017 course addresses about microbiological, epidemiologicaland clinical aspects useful for a current approach to infectious disease. During the last year, nosocomial pneumonia approach guides, recommendations formanagement of yeast and filamentous fungal infections, review papers on theempirical approach to peritonitis and extensive guidelines on stewardship havebeen published. HIV infection is being treated before and more intensively. Theimplementation of molecular biology, spectrometry and inmunology to traditionaltechniques of staining and culture achieve a better and faster microbiologicaldiagnosis. Finally, the infection is increasingly integrated, assessingnon-antibiotic aspects in the treatment.

AB  - Donor natural killer (NK) cells can destroy residual leukemic cells afterallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This effect is based on theinteraction of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) of donor NK cells with ligands of the major histocompatibility complex found on the surface of the target cells. HLA-C1 subtypes provide the ligand for KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 and the HLA-C2 subtypes for KIR2DL1. We have studied the probability of relapse (PR)after single-unit unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in relation to the potential graft-vs.-leukemia effect mediated by NK cells present in the umbilicalcord blood (UCB) by analyzing KIR-ligand and HLA-C typing of the receptor. Datafrom 33 consecutive patients given a single unit UCBT were included. We haveconsidered two groups of patients based on the absence or the presence of one of the C-ligands for inhibitory KIR and the incompatibility HLA-C1/2 between UCB andpatients. Group 1 (n = 21): the patient lacks a C-ligand for inhibitory KIRpresent in UCB NK cells, i.e., patients homozygous C1/C1 or C2/C2. Group 2 (n =12): patients heterozygous C1/C2 in which KIR-mediated graft-vs.-leukemia effect is not expected (presence of both C ligands for inhibitory KIR in the receptor). With a median follow-up post-UCBT of 93 months, patients with absence of aC-ligand for inhibitory KIRs (Group 1) showed a lower actuarial PR than patients with both C-ligands (group 2): 21 +/- 10 vs. 68 +/- 18% at 2 year and 36 +/- 13vs. 84 +/- 14% at 5 years (p = 0.025), respectively. In patients with acutelymphoblastic leukemia, the 2-year PR was 36 +/- 21% for group 1 and 66 +/- 26%for 2 (p = 0.038). Furthermore, group 1 had a lower incidence of grades II-IVacute graft-vs.-host disease (p = 0.04). In the setting of UCBT, the absence of aC-ligand (C1 or C2) of inhibitory KIR in the patient is associated with lower PR,which is probably due to the graft-vs.-host leukemia effect caused by UCB NKcells that lack a ligand for the inhibitory KIR 2DL1/2DL2/2DL3.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major cause of liver diseaseworldwide which often leads to progressive liver inflammation, fibrosis,cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CHC displays heterogeneousprogression depending on a broad set of factors, some of them intrinsic to eachindividual such as the patient's genetic profile. This study aims to evaluate thecontribution of certain genetic variants of crucial interferon alpha and lambdasignaling pathways to the hepatic necroinflammatory activity (NIA) grade of CHCpatients. METHODS: NIA was evaluated in 119 CHC patients by METAVIR scale andclassified as low (NIA = 0-2, n = 80) or high grade (NIA = 3, n = 39). In acandidate gene approach, 64 SNPs located in 30 different genes related tointerferon pathways (IL-28B, IFNAR1-2, JAK-STAT and OAS1-3, among others) weregenotyped using the Illumina GoldenGate(R) Genotyping Assay. Statisticalassociation was determined by logistic regression and expressed as OR and 95% CI.Those SNPs significantly associated were further adjusted by other covariates.RESULTS: Seven SNPs located in IL-28B (rs12979860), JAK1 (rs11576173 andrs1497056), TYK2 (rs280519), OAS1 (rs2057778), SOCS1 (rs33932899) and RNASEL(rs3738579) genes were significantly related to severe NIA grade (p<0.05).Regarding to clinical variables, elevated NIA was notably associated withaspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum levels >40 IU/L (p<0.05) but not withother clinical factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of thesefactors reflected that AST (>40 IU/L), TYK2 rs280519 (G allele) and RNASELrs3738579 (G allele) were factors independently associated with elevated NIA(p<0.05). AST concentration showed a moderate AUC value (AUC = 0.63), similar to TYK2 (rs280519) and RNASEL (rs3738579) SNPs (AUC = 0.61, both) in the ROC_AUCanalysis. Interestingly, the model including all significant variables reached a considerable predictive value (AUC = 0.74). CONCLUSION: The identified geneticvariants in interferon signaling pathways may constitute useful prognosticmarkers of CHC progression. Further validation in larger cohorts of patients isneeded.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have provided conflicting results about how living ina rural or urban environment influences schoolchildren with asthma and allergicdiseases in different ways. The aim of the present study was to evaluate ifrecurrent wheezing preschoolers from rural or urban areas differ in asthma,allergic diseases, and atopy. METHODS: A cross-sectional-study in Rafaela,Argentina, on 143 preschoolers with recurrent wheezing from rural and urbansettings was performed (2010-2012). Diagnosis of asthma (by positive asthmapredictive index [API]), allergic diseases (rhinitis, dermatitis), and atopy (by skin prick test [SPT], peripheral blood eosinophils, and serum total IgE) wereassessed. RESULTS: Preschoolers from rural settings had significantly higherprevalence of vaginal delivery, longer breastfeeding, earlier onset of wheezing, more parental smoking, siblings, shared a bedroom, and more exposure to chemicalsused in plant fumigation or farm animals, and unpasteurized milk consumption, in comparison to preschoolers living in urban setting. In contrast, preschoolersfrom urban areas had significantly higher prevalence of parental history ofallergy, positive skin prick test, and positive API. After multivariate analysis adjusting for covariates, maternal smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 3.44] and positive SPT (OR = 5.57) significantly increase the risk of asthma diagnosis (positiveAPI); in contrast, living in rural setting (OR = 0.04), and having more siblings (OR = 0.51) decrease their risk. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent wheezing preschoolersfrom rural areas had a significant inverse odds of being diagnosed with asthma(type-2 inflammation) when compared to those from urban areas. Exposure to farmanimals and consumption of unpasteurized milk might have a role.

AB  - Meningococcal disease is caused mainly by serogroups A, B, C, Y, W of N.meningitidis. However, numerous cases of meningitis caused by serogroup X N.meningitidis (MenX) have recently been reported in several African countries.Currently, there are no licensed vaccines against this pathogen and most of theMenX cases have been caused by meningococci from clonal complex (c.c) 181.Detergent extracted meningococcal outer membrane vesicle (dOMV) vaccines havepreviously shown to be safe and effective against epidemics of serogroup Bmeningococcal disease in all age groups. The aim of this work is therefore toobtain, characterize and evaluate the vaccine potential of dOMVs derived from aMenX strain (OMVx). Three experimental lots of OMVx were prepared by deoxycholateextraction from the MenX strain BF 2/97. Size and morphology of the vesicles was determined by Dynamic Light Scattering and electron microscopy, whereas theantigenic composition was characterized by gel electrophoresis andimmunoblotting. OMVx were thereafter adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide (OMVx/AL)and two doses of OMVx were administered s.c. to groups of Balb/c mice three weeksapart. The immunogenicity and functional antibody activities in sera wereevaluated by ELISA (anti-OMVx specific IgG responses) and serum bactericidalactivity (SBA) assay. The size range of OMVx was shown to be between 90 and120nm, whereas some of the antigens detected were the outer membrane proteinsPorA, OpcA and RmpM. The OMVx/AL elicited high anti-OMVx antibody responses with bactericidal activity and no bactericidal activity was observed in the controlgroup of no immunised mice. The results demonstrate that OMVx are immunogenic andcould form part of a future vaccine to prevent the majority of meningococcaldisease in the African meningitis belt.

TI  - Mutations in XLF/NHEJ1/Cernunnos gene results in downregulation of telomerasegenes expression and telomere shortening.
PG  - 1900-1914
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx098 [doi]
AB  - NHEJ1-patients develop severe progressive lymphocytopenia and premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at a young age. Here we show a patient with ahomozygous-NHEJ1 mutation identified by whole exome-sequencing that developedsevere pancytopenia and bone marrow aplasia correlating with the presence ofshort telomeres. The mutation resulted in a truncated protein. In an attempt toidentify the mechanism behind the short telomere phenotype found in theNHEJ1-patient we downregulated NHEJ1 expression in 293T and CD34+cells. Thisdownregulation resulted in reduced telomerase activity and decreased expressionof several telomerase/shelterin genes. Interestingly, cell lines derived from twoother NHEJ1-deficient patients with different mutations also showed increased p21expression, inhibition in expression of several telomerase complex genes andshortened telomeres. Decrease in expression of telomerase/shelterin genes did notoccur when we inhibited expression of other NHEJ genes mutated in SCID patients: DNA-PK, Artemis or LigaseIV. Because premature aging of HSCs is observed only in NHEJ1 patients, we propose that is the result of senescence induced by decreased expression of telomerase/shelterin genes that lead to an inhibition of telomeraseactivity. Previous reports failed to find this connection because of the use ofpatient s cells immortalized by TERT expression or recombined telomeres by ALTpathway. In summary, defective regulation of telomere biology together withdefective V(D)J recombination can negatively impact on the evolution of thedisease in these patients. Identification of telomere shortening is importantsince it may open new therapeutic interventions for these patients by treatments aimed to recover the expression of telomerase genes.

TI  - Abnormality of adipokines and endothelial dysfunction in Mexican obeseadolescents with insulin resistance.
PG  - 252-259
LID - 10.1080/07435800.2017.1294601 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship amonginsulin resistance (IR), endothelial dysfunction, and alteration of adipokines inMexican obese adolescents and their association with metabolic syndrome (MetS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven adolescents were classifiedaccording to the body mass index (BMI) (control: N=104; obese: N=123) andhomeostasis model of the assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (obesewith IR: N=65). The circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, solubleintercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and IR were determined by standardmethods. RESULTS: The obese adolescents with IR presented increased presence ofMetS and higher circulating concentrations in sICAM-1 in comparison with theobese subjects without IR. The lowest concentrations of adiponectin were observedin the obese with IR. In multivariate linear regression models, sICAM-1 alongwith triglycerides, total cholesterol, and waist circumference was stronglyassociated with HOMA-IR (R(2)=0.457, P=0.008). Similarly, after adjustment forage, BMI-SDS, lipids, and adipokines, HOMA-IR remained associated with sICAM-1(R(2)=0.372, P=0.008). BMI-SDS was mildly associated with leptin (R(2)=0.176,P=0.002) and the waist circumference was mild and independent determinant ofadiponectin (R(2)=0.136, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated thatthe obese adolescents, particularly the obese subjects with IR exhibitedincreased presence of MetS, abnormality of adipokines, and endothelialdysfunction. The significant interaction between IR and endothelial dysfunctionmay suggest a novel therapeutic approach to prevent or delay systemic IR and the genesis of cardiovascular diseases in obese patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors ofmetalloproteinases could be promising biomarkers for establishing prognosisduring the development of sepsis. It is necessary to clarify the relationshipbetween matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors. We conducted acohort study with 563 septic patients, in order to elucidate the biological role and significance of these inflammatory biomarkers and their relationship to theseverity and mortality of patients with sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amulticentric prospective cohort was performed. The sample was composed ofpatients who had sepsis as defined by the International Conference 2001. Serumprocalcitonin, creatinine, urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, TIMP1, TIMP2, MMP2 and MMP9 were quantified; each patient was followed until death or up to 30 days.A descriptive analysis was performed by calculating the mean and the 95%confidence interval for continuous variables and proportions for categoricalvariables. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed by the methodof intentional selection of covariates with mortality at 30 days as dependentvariable and all the other variables as predictors. RESULTS: Of the 563 patients,68 patients (12.1%) died within the first 30 days of hospitalization in the ICU. The mean values for TIMP1, TIMP2 and MMP2 were lower in survivors, MMP9 washigher in survivors. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age, SOFA andCharlson scores, along with TIMP1 concentration, were statistically associatedwith mortality at 30 days of septic patients; serum MMP9 was not statisticallyassociated with mortality of patients, but was a confounder of the TIMP1variable. CONCLUSION: It could be argued that plasma levels of TIMP1 should beconsidered as a promising prognostic biomarker in the setting of sepsis.Additionally, this study, like other studies with large numbers of septicpatients does not support the predictive value of TIMP1 / MMP9.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant patients with D+/R+ serology can be treated witheither prophylaxis or preemptive valganciclovir. The older transplant population suffers severe immunosenescence, especially patients with latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (R+). They are more likely to develop indirect CMV effects.Likewise, many patients have significant cardiovascular comorbidity, which makes them more sensitive to these indirect effects. The aim of this study was toevaluate the incidence of CMV viremia and indirect effects on survival, comparingprophylaxis (V) against preemptive (P) valganciclovir in an older kidneytransplant population. METHODS: We analyzed the data of 233 recipients from 2002 (age, >55 years; D+/R+) with >/=6 months of follow-up. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 167 (71.7%) in the V group and 66 (28.3%) in the P group. RESULTS:The incidence of CMV infection in the P group was 32% versus 6% in V group.Patients with CMV viremia showed worse survival values than patients withoutviremia (log rank P = .031). Five-year survivals were 74% vs 88%, respectively.Cox regression showed that the adjusted effect of CMV infection on overallsurvival was a significant risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.003-4.29).Patients with CMV viremia showed worse cardiovascular survival than patientswithout viremia, with 5-year survivals of 79% vs 94%. Cox regression showed that the adjusted effect of CMV infection was a significant risk (HR, 2.62).CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection has a detrimental effect on the survival of olderpatients. Valganciclovir prophylaxis induces a protective effect against CMVinfection and could improve survival of older patients with cardiovascularcomorbidities.

TI  - Hypothermia can reverse hepatic oxidative stress damage induced by hypoxia inrats.
PG  - 615-623
AB  - Our previous findings demonstrated that hypothermia enhances the reductionpotential in the liver and helps to maintain the plasmatic antioxidant pool.Here, we aimed to elucidate if hypothermia protects against hypoxia-inducedoxidative stress damage in rat liver. Several hepatic markers of oxidative stresswere compared in three groups of animals (n = 8 in each group): controlnormothermic group ventilated with room air and two groups under extreme hypoxia (breathing 10 % O2), one kept at normothermia (HN) (37 degrees C) and the otherunder deep hypothermia (HH) (central body temperature of 21-22 degrees C).Hypoxia in normothermia significantly increased the levels of hepatic nitricoxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, protein oxidation,Carbonilated proteins, advanced oxidation protein products, 4-hydroxynonenal(HNE) protein adducts, and lipid peroxidation when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). However, when hypoxia was induced under hypothermia, results from theoxidative stress biomarker analyses did not differ significantly from those foundin the control group. Indeed, 4-HNE protein adduct amounts were significantlylower in the HH versus HN group (p < 0.05). Therefore, hypothermia can mitigatehypoxia-induced oxidative stress damage in rat liver. These effects could helpclarify the mechanisms of action of therapeutic hypothermia.

AB  - Darevskia rock lizards include both sexual and parthenogenetic species, mostlydistributed in the heterogeneous and ecologically diverse Caucasus. Theparthenogenetic species originated via directional hybridogenesis, with only someof the sexual species known to serve as parentals. However, it remains unclearwhen and where these events happened and how many parental lineages wereinvolved. A multilocus phylogeographic analysis was performed on the parthenogensD. unisexualis, D. bendimahiensis and D. uzzeli, and their putative maternalspecies D. raddei. Results show the parthenogenetic species all have relativelyrecent origins, approximately 200-70kyr ago, and at least three hybridizationevents were involved in their formation. Ecological niche models identify theregion where hybridization events leading to the formation of D. unisexualis tookplace, namely in the northeast of the current distribution. Models also suggestthat the sexual D. raddei might have undergone a habitat shift between the LastInterglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum.

TI  - Early mortality in multiple myeloma: the time-dependent impact of comorbidity: A population-based study in 621 real-life patients.
PG  - 700-4
LID - 10.1002/ajh.24389 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease with variable survival; thisvariability cannot be fully explained by the current systems of riskstratification. Early mortality remains a serious obstacle to further improve thetrend toward increased survival demonstrated in recent years. However, thedefinition of early mortality is not standardized yet. Importantly, no study has focused on the impact of comorbidity on early mortality in multiple myeloma todate. Therefore, we analyzed the role of baseline comorbidity in a largepopulation-based cohort of 621 real-life myeloma patients over a 31-year period. To evaluate early mortality, a sequential multivariate regression model at 2, 6, and 12 months from diagnosis was performed. It was demonstrated that comorbidity had an independent impact on early mortality, which is differential andtime-dependent. Besides renal failure, respiratory disease at 2 months, liverdisease at 6 months, and hepatitis virus C infection at 12 months, were,respectively, associated with early mortality, adjusting for otherwell-established prognostic factors. On the other hand, the long-term monitoring in our study points out a modest downward trend in early mortality over time.This is the first single institution population-based study aiming to assess the impact of comorbidity on early mortality in multiple myeloma. It is suggestedthat early mortality should be analyzed at three key time points (2, 6, and 12months), in order to allow comparisons between studies. Comorbidity plays acritical role in the outcome of myeloma patients in terms of early mortality. Am.J. Hematol. 91:700-704, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Since its discovery the cellular prion protein (encoded by the Prnp gene) hasbeen associated with a large number of functions. The proposed functions rankfrom basic cellular processes such as cell cycle and survival to neural functionssuch as behavior and neuroprotection, following a pattern similar to that ofMoore's law for electronics. In addition, particular interest is increasing inthe participation of Prnp in neurodegeneration. However, in recent years aredefinition of these functions has begun, since examples of previouslyattributed functions were increasingly re-associated with other proteins. Most ofthese functions are linked to so-called "Prnp-flanking genes" that are close tothe genomic locus of Prnp and which are present in the genome of some Prnp mouse models. In addition, their role in neuroprotection against convulsive insults hasbeen confirmed in recent studies. Lastly, in recent years a large number ofmodels indicating the participation of different domains of the protein inapoptosis have been uncovered. However, after more than 10 years of moleculardissection our view is that the simplest mechanistic model in PrP(C)-mediatedcell death should be considered, as Ockham's razor theory suggested.

AB  - The increasing human presence in Antarctica and the waste it generates is causingan impact on the environment at local and border scale. The main sources ofanthropic pollution have a mainly local effect, and include the burning of fossilfuels, waste incineration, accidental spillage and wastewater effluents, evenwhen treated. The aim of this work is to determine the presence and origin of 30 substances of anthropogenic origin considered to be, or suspected of being,endocrine disruptors in the continental waters of the Antarctic Peninsula region.We also studied a group of toxic metals, metalloids and other elements withpossible endocrine activity. Ten water samples were analyzed from a wide range ofsources, including streams, ponds, glacier drain, and an urban wastewaterdischarge into the sea. Surprisingly, the concentrations detected are generallysimilar to those found in other studies on continental waters in other parts ofthe world. The highest concentrations of micropollutants found correspond to the group of organophosphate flame retardants (19.60-9209ngL(-1)) and alkylphenols(1.14-7225ngL(-1)); and among toxic elements the presence of aluminum (a possiblehormonal modifier) (1.7-127microgL(-1)) is significant. The concentrationsdetected are very low and insufficient to cause acute or subacute toxicity inaquatic organisms. However, little is known as yet of the potential sublethal andchronic effects of this type of pollutants and their capacity forbioaccumulation. These results point to the need for an ongoing system ofenvironmental monitoring of these substances in Antarctic continental waters, andthe advisability of regulating at least the most environmentally hazardous ofthese in the Antarctic legislation.

TI  - The Genotype of the Donor for the (GT)n Polymorphism in the Promoter/Enhancer of FOXP3 Is Associated with the Development of Severe Acute GVHD but Does Not Affectthe GVL Effect after Myeloablative HLA-Identical Allogeneic Stem CellTransplantation.
PG  - e0140454

AB  - The FOXP3 gene encodes for a protein (Foxp3) involved in the development andfunctional activity of regulatory T cells (CD4+/CD25+/Foxp3+), which exertregulatory and suppressive roles over the immune system. After allogeneic stemcell transplantation, regulatory T cells are known to mitigate graft versus host disease while probably maintaining a graft versus leukemia effect. Short alleles (</=(GT)15) for the (GT)n polymorphism in the promoter/enhancer of FOXP3 areassociated with a higher expression of FOXP3, and hypothetically with an increaseof regulatory T cell activity. This polymorphism has been related to thedevelopment of auto- or alloimmune conditions including type 1 diabetes or graft rejection in renal transplant recipients. However, its impact in theallo-transplant setting has not been analyzed. In the present study, whichincludes 252 myeloablative HLA-identical allo-transplants, multivariate analysis revealed a lower incidence of grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD)in patients transplanted from donors harboring short alleles (OR = 0.26, CI0.08-0.82, p = 0.021); without affecting chronic GVHD or graft versus leukemiaeffect, since cumulative incidence of relapse, event free survival and overallsurvival rates are similar in both groups of patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is the most common microdeletionsyndrome with an incidence of 1:4000 live births. Its phenotype is highlyvariable with facial, velopharyngeal, cardiac, endocrine, immunologic andpsychiatric abnormalities. It is caused by a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.2.OBJECTIVES: We present 7 years of experience evaluating patients with VCFSregarding their main clinical characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patientsincluded were multidisciplinary evaluated and had a positive FISH analysis fordel22q11.2. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were assessed, a 34 female/28 maleratio was observed with ages ranging from 9 days to 16 years, all but one patienthad typical facial features. A diagnosis of congenital heart disease wasestablished in 97% of the patients; other clinical characteristics wereidentified with different percentages such as cleft palate, and hypocalcaemia.Three cases had a familial presentation. DISCUSSION: While the clinical findings of this study were in general terms in keeping with the literature, it isinteresting the unexpectedly high percentage of congenital heart diseaseidentified in Mexican children with VCFS that also was the main cause forclinical referral.

AB  - Several studies have found cocaine and its main active metabolite benzoylecgonine(BE) in the aquatic environment and drinking water, derived from its consumption by humans as well as the inability of water treatment processes to eliminate it. A few studies have already investigated the ecotoxicology of BE to aquaticinvertebrates, but none has still addressed the effects of BE on aquaticvertebrates or vascular plants. The goal of this publication is to provideinformation on the toxicity of environmental concentrations of BE during animaland vascular plant development, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the potential risk of this substance for the environment. BE inducedalterations in mitochondrial activity and DNA levels of fern spores atenvironmental concentrations (1 ng L(-1)), which could disrupt gametophytegermination. However, BE at concentrations ranging from 1 ng L(-1) to 1 mg L(-1) did not disturb morphogenesis, hatching, heartbeat rate or larval motility in azebrafish embryo-larval model. Adverse effects on ferns agree with theallelophathic role described for alkaloids and their unspecific interference withplant germination. Therefore, the anthropogenic dispersion of alkaloidallelochemicals may pose a risk for biodiversity and irrigated food productionthat should be further investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the progress made in recent years, multiple myeloma is still considered an incurable disease. Most survival data come from clinical trials.Little is known about the outcome in unselected real-life patients. METHODS:Overall survival was analyzed in a cohort of newly diagnosed symptomatic multiplemyeloma patients, over the last three decades, in a single institutionpopulation-based study. RESULTS: 582 consecutive myeloma patients were includedin the study. Survival increased over time in patients younger than 65 years but did not reach statistical significance in patients with 65 years or older. Theprognostic factors associated with overall survival were the InternationalStaging System, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level, the renal impairment, the realization of autologous stem cell transplantation, and the presence ofconcomitant amyloidosis. Overall survival shows a steady improvement over time.INTERPRETATION: The survival of myeloma is improving progressively in real-lifepatients, particularly after the widespread use of the novel agents. Acomprehensive assessment of comorbidity can help to explain the hugeheterogeneity of myeloma outcome. The optimization of current therapeuticresources as well as the incorporation of new drugs will allow furtherimprovement of survival in the coming years.

PG  - 1650-60
LID - 10.4161/hv.28620 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to estimate incidence density rates (IDR) ofherpes zoster (HZ) and to analyze the association with sociodemographiccharacteristics and selected chronic medical conditions. The study cohortconsisted of the adult population included in the Public Health System of theAutonomous Community of Madrid, Spain on 1/10/2009 (5 244 402 persons). Datasource were electronic medical records from primary care between1/10/2009-31/12/2012. Individual socioeconomic status (SES) was inferred bygeocoding. Poisson regression analyses were stratified by sex, to identifyfactors associated with HZ. We identified 81 541 incident cases of HZ (61.7% inwomen and 46.5% in the group aged 60 and over). IDR was 4.11 per 1000person-years in men and 5.95 in women. IDR were higher with age, in autochthonouspopulation, those with lower SES and in patients with immunodeficiencies. Afteradjustment, higher incidence rate ratios were found with age, autochthonousorigin, lower SES, and in patients with HIV-infection/AIDS (3.20, CI95% 2.90-3.53in men and 2.98, CI95% 2.58-3.45 in women), and other immunodeficiencies (1.57,CI95% 1.41-1.75 and 1.65, CI95% 1.50-1.80). COPD, asthma, DM, ischemic heartdisease, other cardiovascular diseases, and cancer were also associated with anincreased incidence of HZ. We conclude that older, autochthonous patients withlower SES and with certain underlying medical conditions had a higher probabilityof suffering HZ. Electronic databases are useful for estimating the incidence of HZ, and for finding associations with sociodemographic and clinicalcharacteristics. Identifying unrecognized risk factors for HZ, such as asthma or cardiovascular diseases, is crucial to interpret the epidemiology of HZ, totarget vaccination programs and to monitor their effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 1 interferon (IFNalpha/beta) has a significant role inestablishing protection against virus infections. It has been well documented by in vitro studies that dengue virus (DENV) activates a robust IFNalpha/betaresponse. However, DENV also induces a down-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway,inhibiting the induction of interferon regulated genes. As a consequence, therole played by the IFN type 1 response in the protection of dengue patients isnot fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To compare IFN-alpha levels in dengue patientswith dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) undergoing primary orsecondary infections. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred and four serum samples wereanalyzed for IFN-alpha level by cytometric bead array. Patients' clinicalcondition was assigned following the WHO 1997 criteria and specific IgG and IgMantibodies were measured using commercial assays to determine primary andsecondary infections. The infecting serotype was determined by qRT-PCR. RESULTSAND CONCLUSION: The IFN-alpha levels were found significantly higher in DF thanDHF patients irrespective of the infecting serotype (DENV1 or 2), and were found to decline rapidly at day 3 after fever onset. For DENV2 infections, higherIFN-alpha level was found during primary than secondary infections. These resultssuggest that an early strong interferon response correlates with a betterclinical condition.

AB  - Shellfish complying with European Regulations based on quantification of fecalbacterial indicators (FIB) are introduced into markets; however, information onviruses, more stable than FIB, is not available in the literature. To assess the presence of noroviruses (NoVs) GI and GII and human adenoviruses (HAdV) indomestic and imported mussels and clams (n = 151) their presence was analyzedduring winter seasons (2004-2008) in north-west Spanish markets through a routinesurveillance system. All samples tested negative for NoV GI and 13 % werepositive for NoV GII. The role of HAdV as viral indicator was evaluated in 20negative and 10 positive NoV GII samples showing an estimated sensitivity andspecificity of HAdV to predict the presence of NoV GII of 100 and 74 % (cut-off0.5). The levels of HAdV and NoVs and the efficiency of decontamination inshellfish depuration plants (SDP) were evaluated analyzing pre- andpost-depurated mussels collected in May-June 2010 from three different SDP. Therewere no statistically significant differences in the prevalence andquantification of HAdV between pre- and post-depurated shellfish and betweenseawater entering and leaving the depuration systems. Moreover, infectious HAdVwere detected in depurated mussels. These results confirm previous studiesshowing that current controls and depuration treatments limiting the number ofFIB do not guarantee the absence of viruses in shellfish.

AB  - The present study uses a probabilistic model to determine the growth/no growthinterfaces of the spoilage wine yeast Dekkera bruxellensis CH29 as a function of ethanol (10-15%, v/v), pH (3.4-4.0) and free SO2 (0-50 mg/l) using time (7, 14,21 and 30 days) as a dummy variable. The model, built with a total of 756growth/no growth data obtained in a simile wine medium, could have application inthe winery industry to determine the wine conditions needed to inhibit the growthof this species. Thereby, at 12.5% of ethanol and pH 3.7 for a growth probabilityof 0.01, it is necessary to add 30 mg/l of free SO2 to inhibit yeast growth for 7days. However, the concentration of free SO2 should be raised to 48 mg/l toachieve a probability of no growth of 0.99 for 30 days under the same wineconditions. Other combinations of environmental variables can also be determined using the mathematical model depending on the needs of the industry.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are chemical compounds with the ability to alter the hormonal systems of organisms. Such compounds are used in severalindustrial and domestic activities and reach the aquatic environment viawastewater discharge. The aim of this study is to assess the occurrence of 30EDCs and related compounds in the surface waters of central Spain and todetermine the overall estrogenic activity of environmental samples. This studyanalyzed a large number of EDCs and other emergent or suspected compounds withendocrine-disrupting activity. The results have shown the presence of 19 EDCs at concentrations ranging from 2 to 5928 ng L(-1). Organophosphorus-based flameretardants, alkylphenolic compounds and anticorrosives were found at the highest concentrations. Furthermore, although insufficient data are available tocalculate an average over time, these preliminary results show the need tomonitor the waters in both rivers studied. Alkylphenolic compounds, particularly nonylphenol, were the main contributors to overall estrogenicity. A higherconcentration of the compounds studied was detected in the river Jarama, althoughthe estrogenicity expressed as estradiol equivalents (EEQs) was higher in theriver Manzanares due to a higher concentration of nonylphenol. However, the totalestrogenicity did not exceed 1 ng L(-1) (EEQ), which is the level that may cause estrogenic effects in aquatic organisms, in any of the samples. In conclusion,the potential estrogenic risk in both rivers is low, althoughorganophosphorus-based flame retardants may increase this risk as they were foundat high levels in all samples. Unfortunately, these compounds could not be taken into account when calculating the estrogenic activity due to the lack of activitydata for them. For future investigations, it will be important to assess theestrogenicity provided by these flame retardants. Due to the significantconcentrations of EDCs detected in both rivers, further studies in this regionare required.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Raw-milk cheese has been identified in risk assessment as a food ofgreater concern to public health due to listeriosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and levels of Listeria monocytogenes in semi-hard Idiazabal cheesemanufactured by different producers in the Basque Country at consumer level.METHODOLOGY: A total of 51 Idiazabal cheese samples were obtained from 10separate retail establishments, chosen by stratified random sampling. Sampleswere tested using the official standard ISO procedure 11290-1 for detection andenumeration methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All cheese samples tested negativefor L. monocytogenes. However, 9.8% tested positive for Listeria spp., different from L. monocytogenes. Positive samples came from two brands, two were naturaland three were smoked. The presence of Listeria spss. suggests that the cheesemaking process and the hygiene whether at milking or during cheese making couldbe insufficient.

TI  - CD133 antisense suppresses cancer cell growth and increases sensitivity tocisplatin in vitro.
PG  - 901-905
AB  - The increased incidence of cancer in recent years is associated with a high rate of mortality. Numerous types of cancer have a low percentage of CD133(+) cells,which have similar features to stem cells. The CD133 molecule is involved inapoptosis and cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to determine thebiological effect of CD133 suppression and its role in the chemosensitization of cancer cell lines. RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analyses indicated that CD133was expressed in the cancer cell lines B16F10, MCF7 and INER51. Downregulation ofCD133 by transfection with an antisense sequence (As-CD133) resulted in adecrease in cancer cell viability of up to 52, 47 and 22% in B16F10, MCF-7 andINER51 cancer cell lines, respectively. This decreased viability appeared to bedue to the induction of apoptosis. In addition, treatment with As-CD133 incombination with cisplatin had a synergic effect in all of the cancer cell lines analyzed, and in particular, significantly decreased the viability of B16F10cancer cells compared with each treatment separately (3.1% viability for thecombined treatment compared with 48% for 0.4 mug As-CD133 and 25% for 5 ng/mulcisplatin; P<0.05). The results indicate that the downregulation of CD133 byantisense is a potential therapeutic target for cancer and has a synergisticeffect when administered with minimal doses of the chemotherapeutic drugcisplatin, suggesting that this combination strategy may be applied in cancertreatment.

AB  - The relative frequency of the different forms of SCID may vary in differentcountries. The most frequent form in Israel is the autosomal-recessive T-B- SCID or Omenn syndrome while X-linked SCID is rare. We report our immunological andgenetic analyses in multicentre study of patients presenting with either T-B-SCID or Omenn syndrome. Among 16 patients, we identified 7 novel mutations in 6patients. In the RAG1 gene we detected two novel mutations: L454Q and 469fs-4bpdel. In the RAG 2 gene: 3 novel mutations: D65Y, G157V, and E480X. One T-B-SCID patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for new mutations in the ADAgene: W264X and R235W. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 8 families whileothers refused due to religious reasons. Identification of the new mutationsexpands our knowledge regarding the unique features of SCID phenotype in Israeland may help the families seeking for genetic counseling.

AB  - This work analyzes the influence of environmental and physiological parameters onPAHs accumulation in cultured mussels. Lipid content and reproductive stage aredirectly related with PAHs accumulation pattern. We observed a rapid accumulationand depuration of PAHs, mainly during periods of nutrients accumulation, spawnsand gonadic restorations. Correlations between PAHs accumulation andphysiological status indicate when mussels are more susceptible to adverseeffects of these pollutants. A positive correlation between mutagenic congener's accumulation and occurrence of gonadic neoplastic disorders is shown for thefirst time in mussels. Molecular indices were used to identify the origin ofhydrocarbons accumulated by Mytilus, showing a chronic pyrolytic pollution andpollutant episodes by petrogenic sources and biomass combustion in the studiedarea. Multivariate analysis suggests the possibility of including physiologicalparameters of sentinel organisms in environmental biomonitoring programs, mainly in aquaculture areas, taking into account their two aspects: farms productivityand human food safety.

TI  - Determining infants' age for measles vaccination based on persistence ofprotective level of maternal measles antibody.
PG  - 101-4
AB  - The present study was conducted over a period of one year to find the right time for measles vaccination when maternal antibody titer in infants was decayedrendering them susceptible to wild virus infection. Blood samples were collected from the cord of new born (147), 2-5 months (47) and 5 to 7.5 months (24) of age.The mean measles IgG antibody titer detected in cord blood at birth (0 months)was 348.8 mlU/mL which steeply decreased to 155.6 mlU/mL by the age of 2-3months. After that the fall in antibody becomes relatively slower and decreasedto 101.6 mIU/mL by the age of 3-5 months and 38.8 mlU/mL by the age of 5-6 monthsand to 19.2 mIU/mL between the age of 6 to 7.5 months. The fall in antibody levelwith the advance of age was statistically significant (p < 0.001 ). Majority ofthe subjects (97.6%) exhibited protective level of antibody at birth. But only a little above one-quarter (25.5%) of them persisted the protective level betweenthe age of 2-5 months and none had protective level from 5 months onwards.

TI  - [Immune response of Hansen's disease. Review].
PG  - 513-27
AB  - Hansen's disease presents a wide spectrum of clinical and histopathologicalmanifestations that reflect the nature of the immunological response of the host towards diverse Mycobacterium leprae components. The immunological system,composed by both innate and adaptive immunology, offers protection towardsinfections of various etiologies, among them bacterial. Bacteria, of course, havedeveloped multiple strategies for evading host defenses, based on either verycomplex or simple mechanisms, but with a single purpose: to "resist" host attacksand to be able to survive. We have tried to summarize some recent studies inHansen's disease, with more emphasis in the inmunology area. We think that in thefuture, all illnesses should also be very strongly related to other importantaspects such as the social, environmental and economic, and whose development is not solved in a laboratory.

TI  - Risk factors of developing asthma in children with recurrent wheezing in thefirst three years of life.
PG  - 228-31
AB  - INTRODUCTION: recurrent wheezing is a common problem during the first years oflife, but it is still difficult to identify which of these children may developasthma in the future. OBJECTIVES: To study risk factors of developing asthma in agroup of patients with frequent wheezing during the first three years of life.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed of a group of 60patients, aged below three, referred to our Hospital for recurrent wheezing. Age,sex, parental and personal history of atopy, clinical features, laboratory tests,evolution and response to treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: 60 patients wereenrolled in study. Most of children were boys and have had the first episode ofwheezing after the 6 months of life. 63 % had personal history of atopy and 55 % parental history of allergy. The group of atopic children had more wheezingexacerbations and worse evolution than the group of non atopic. They also hadmore treatment necessities. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of young children at high risk of developing asthma could permit an early intervention beforeirreversible changes in the airway appeared.

TI  - Biological role of pituitary estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta onprogesterone receptor expression and action and on gonadotropin and prolactinsecretion in the rat.
PG  - 247-58
AB  - Estrogen (E) is a key regulator of the synthesis and secretion of pituitaryreproductive hormones [luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH) and prolactin (PRL)]. Until recently, it was thought that all biologicalactions of E at the pituitary were manifested through a single E receptor (R).The pituitary, like many other reproductive tissues, expresses two isoforms ofER, alpha and beta, both activated by E. The relative contribution of alpha andbeta forms in E regulatory actions is largely unknown. To this end, 2-week-oldovariectomized (OVX) rats were injected over 3 days with 25 microg estradiolbenzoate (EB), 1.5 mg of propylpyrazole triol (PPT), a selective ERalpha agonist,1.5 mg of the selective ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) or a combinationof PPT and DPN. Controls were injected with 0.2 ml oil. At 10:00 h on the dayafter treatment, trunk blood was collected to determine serum concentration ofLH, FSH and PRL, and pituitaries were processed for RT-PCR analysis of total(A+B) progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA, immunocytochemistry of PR and incubation. Pituitaries from each of the five groups were incubated in DMEM, with or without 20 nM of the antiprogestin at the receptor ZK299, for 3 h with: 10(-8)M17beta-estradiol, 10(-6)M PPT, 10(-6)M DPN, PPT+DPN or medium alone,respectively, to determine LH, FSH and PRL secretion, and, when challenged withtwo pulses of 15 min 1 h apart of 10(-8)M gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)(GnRH self-priming). EB, PPT and PPT+DPN treatments increased PR mRNA and thenumber and intensity of nuclei immunoreactive (IR) for PR in gonadotropes, andreduced the number of gonadectomy cells. Like E, PPT alone or in combination withDPN stimulated PRL secretion, increased basal and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSHsecretion and induced GnRH self-priming in the absence of ZK299 in the incubationmedium. DPN alone had only a significant E-like effect on gonadectomy cells andIR-PR, but not on GnRH self-priming. In addition, while DPN lacked an agonisticaction on peripheral tissue and serum pituitary reproductive hormonesconcentration, EB, PPT and PPT+DPN induced similar uterine ballooning and vaginalcornification, and increased and decreased, respectively, serum concentrations ofPRL and gonadotropins. Overall, these results indicate that most of these Eactions on the pituitary are exerted through the ERalpha isoform. The findingthat activation of ERbeta with its selective DPN agonist had an estrogenic effecton IR-PR nuclei, but not on GnRH self-priming, a characteristic ERalpha-mediated effect of E, suggests that the biological action of E at the pituitary mayinvolve both isoforms of ER.

TI  - Control of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production using antioxidants atdifferent conditions of water activity and pH.
PG  - 279-87
AB  - AIMS: The effect of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene(BHT), trihydroxybutyrophenone (THB) and propyl paraben (PP) (at concentrationsof 1, 10 and 20 mmol l(-1)) on germination, growth and aflatoxin B1 production byAspergillus section Flavi was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies on thepercentage of spore germination, elongation rate, growth rate and aflatoxin B1production were carried out in vitro in relation to water activity (aw) at 0.982,0.937, 0.809 and 0.747 values. At 0.809 and 0.747aw values none of the isolateswas able to germinate. Overall, PP and BHA were the antioxidants most effectiveat inhibiting germination of both species. In the presence of the lowestconcentration of BHA and PP (1 mmol l(-1)) the conidial germination percentageranged from 2 to 19% after 15 h of incubation at the highest water activitytested. BHA and PP at 10-20 mmol l(-1) completely inhibited conidial germination.The antioxidants more efficient in controlling Aspergillus elongation rate werePP, BHT and BHA. All strains were much more sensitive to all antioxidants tested on the percentage of spore germination and growth rate at 0.937aw. Theantioxidants PP and BHA completely inhibited aflatoxin B1 production by allstrains when added at 1 mmol l(-1). Decreased aflatoxin B1 levels in comparisonwith the control, were observed with BHT at 1, 10 and 20 mmol(-1) with the strainT20 at 0.982aw. In contrast, stimulation was observed with the antioxidant THB at10 and 20 mmol l(-1) at 0.937aw with the strains T20 and T23. The effect of BHAand PP at 1 mmol l(-1) on lag phase and growth rate was maintained in the pHrange between 6 and 8. At all pH values the inhibitory effect of BHA was higherthan PP. No aflatoxin B1 was detected at all pH values. CONCLUSIONS: The datashow that BHA and PP could be considered as effective fungitoxicants for A.flavus and A. parasiticus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The information obtained show promise for controlling growth and aflatoxin B1 in stored maize.Futher studies should be carried out to examine the potential for antioxidants,such as BHA and PP to effectively control both growth and aflatoxin production.

TI  - Lead and lead toxicity in domestic and free living birds.
PG  - 3-13
AB  - At present, domestic and wild fauna are being exposed to aspects and factorswhich are foreign to the habitat in which they live. One that stands out is theenormous amount and variety of chemical compounds which, in many cases, arehighly complex and which are constantly being released into the atmosphere,mainly from agricultural and industrial activity. All these substances affectsome species more than others, whether they be plants or animals, from the mostinsignificant micro-organism to the most evolved species, among them birds.Finally, another cause of mortality in many birds is plumbism, namely deathcaused by the ingestion of lead. Lead has been one of the main causes ofpoisoning in man since ancient times due to its use in many activities althoughit is only recently that this toxicity has been recognized. Moreover, the use of lead pellets for shooting has resulted in the release into the environment ofmillions of these over many years, with serious repercussions for many birdspecies populations, which have ingested them either directly or indirectly.Added to this use of lead in cynegetic activities is the fate of the lead weights(sinkers or ballast) used by rod fishers, which sink to the bottom or accumulate on the banks of rivers, lakes, lagoons or reservoirs. The problem arises whenthese pellets or weights are ingested by birds, mainly Anatidae, which mistakethem for the small stones or grit they use to triturate food in their gizzards.Small particles of lead enter the digestive tract, start dissolving in the formof lead salts, are incorporated into the bloodstream and the rest of the body,accumulate in organs like the liver or kidneys, and cause physiological orbehavioural changes. When certain concentrations of lead are reached, the birdsthen die. If lead-poisoned birds are consumed by carrions or predators, thelatter also ingest the lead so that they may also be affected or die fromplumbism since, being a heavy metal, its degradation and/or elimination is verydifficult. There is, therefore, no doubt that millions of birds die annuallyworldwide from lead poisoning (in the U.S.A., around 3,000,000), this problembeing most acute in marshland. The solutions could include the introduction oflegislation regulating or banning shooting, in the use of non-toxic ammunition inmarshes and protected areas, the substitution of lead pellets for other non-toxicones, such as steel, bismuth, tungsten or other suitable metals, and to go onstudying other possible alternatives to end such a dramatic situation for birdsall over the world.

TI  - Chemokines, their receptors, and transplant outcome.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Organ transplant rejection is mediated largely by circulating peripheralleukocytes induced to infiltrate the graft by various inflammatory stimuli. Ofthese, chemotactic cytokines called chemokines, expressed by inflamed grafttissues, as well as by early innate-responding leukocytes that infiltrate thegraft, are responsible for the recruitment of alloreactive leukocytes. Thisreport discusses the impact of these leukocyte-directing proteins on transplantoutcome and novel therapeutic approaches for antirejection therapy based ontargeting of chemokines and/or their receptors.

PG  - 1181-3
AB  - CD4 T-cell percentages, viral load and thymic function measured as T-cellreceptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC) levels were determined every 2-3months in six treated HIV-infected children for 4 years. All children experienceda marked increase in CD4 cell count after therapy, accompanied by a concomitantlymarked increase in TREC levels. In children, the decrease in viral load caused byantiviral therapy leads to an increase in CD4 T cells, mainly because of arecovery in the thymic production of new T cells.

The method isfaster and shows greater reproducibility than Bjerknes' (1984) standard techniqueusing propidium iodide-stained Candida albicans, conventionally applied to theleukocytic layer of peripheral blood but here modified for HCPB. We also report amodification of Bjerknes' Intracellular Killing Test to allow its application to HCPB.
